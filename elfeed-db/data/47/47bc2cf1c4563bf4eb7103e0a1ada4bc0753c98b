Over the past few days, I've been reflecting on the personality trait
of conscientiousness, which is something that can
be a bit of a struggle for me. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness">Wikipedia</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Conscientiousness is the personality trait of being responsible, careful, or diligent. Conscientiousness implies a desire to do a task well, and to take obligations to others seriously. Conscientious people tend to be efficient and organized as opposed to easy-going and disorderly. They tend to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement; they display planned rather than spontaneous behavior; and they are generally dependable. Conscientiousness manifests in characteristic behaviors such as being neat, systematic, careful, thorough, and deliberate (tending to think carefully before acting).

<p>
I think of myself as not very conscientious. At
school, I struggled with completing homework,
sometimes not even turning in assigned essays. I
forgot about deadlines and accidentally left my
stuff behind. I did well on standardized tests
because I could read quickly and eliminate
probably incorrect answers, but other types of
tests were a drag. There were some subjects I
liked enough to do well in (well, mostly teachers
I found engaging). For the most part, though, I
didn't particularly care about grades. Even as an
adult, I occasionally forget to finish something
I'm working on, I lose things and time due to
disorganization and attentional hiccups, and I've
used my "Oops" fund a number of times. (W+ is more
conscientious than I am, and occasionally
patiently reminds me to take care of stuff.) I
tend to follow the butterflies of my interest.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, I've figured out some things that
work well for me. Coding is great because even
though it needs me to be pretty exact, I can work
in small chunks, write tests to help me
double-check, and automate repetitive tasks that
my brain tends to hiccup on. When I worked at IBM,
I had a lot of fun working on projects I cared
about, like building systems to help professionals
transition into teaching or helping food banks
distribute food. I also did well skimming pages
and pages of internal discussions so that I could
summarize key themes for workshops. For my
consulting clients, I tend to focus on prototyping
their crazy ideas. If the idea proves worthwhile,
we can then turn it over to other people to get it
ready for production. Org Mode helps me keep track
of what I want to do and when. In the Emacs
community, I tend to focus on breadth rather than
depth: Emacs News instead of package maintenance
or core Emacs development. (And besides, it's
volunteering anyhow, so when people bump into bugs
in my code, it's either an opportunity for them to
help out or something they might just put up with
or work around.) I like experimenting, and I don't
feel stuck; I can move on from an experiment when
I've gotten enough data or when things change.
I've shifted my life so that most of the tasks on
my to-do list are things that I want to do that
aren't time-sensitive, so I can do them when I
want.

I recognize myself in other descriptions of
conscientiousness. I like to plan and I like to
take notes. I get somewhat stressed by the idea of
being late, although I've learned to chill out a
little about that because kids mean being flexible
about time. I like considering decisions carefully
and doing little experiments. I find risky
behaviour stressful rather than fun. Still, I tend
to think of myself as someone who doesn't do the
extra work, who often doesn't pay attention to the
fiddly details. A few counter-examples might help
me figure out more about when my brain likes to
spend the extra time on things:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In a cryptography course that I took in
university, we had an assignment to break a
simple monalphabetic cipher. Each student was assigned
one line. I had fun crunching through all of
them (puzzles! piece of cake) and I distinctly
remember relishing the teachers' surprise the
next day.</li>

<li>I signed up for more school, getting a master's degree in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. I got interested in it for two reasons:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I enjoyed teaching computer science at my alma mater. Getting an advanced degree was strongly recommended. I experimented with a masters in education but I wasn't that interested in it.</li>
<li>I was also interested in personal information management thanks to Emacs and Planner Mode, so I was curious about exploring the usage patterns of people who had highly customized their PIM tool. Several papers in that area had been written by a researcher at the University of Toronto, so I applied there for a master's. That researcher left shortly after I arrived, so we looked around for another topic. Eventually we settled on social networking platforms in organizations, which was also interesting for me because it was about how people use technology to organize collective knowledge.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>I also signed up for parenting knowing
that it's a ton of extra work including
stress-testing my abilities, being responsible
for helping an entirely separate little being
figure out things I'm still figuring out myself,
and handling endless problem-solving and
adaptation in the face of uncertainty.</li>

<li>I notice that I'm getting a little better at
slowing down and practising piano, singing, and
drawing. I've tried all these things before, but
now I can approach it differently because I'm
going into it with more life experience.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For piano, I can treat it like a moving
meditation on the quirks of my monkey mind,
and be amused at how my brain learns. I
enjoy feeling the motions become more
automatic. I also like the thoughts and
memories that the pieces evoke. (As part of
this beginner course I'm doing, I just
practised a very simple version of "Thus Spake
Zarathustra", which makes everything feel more
epic.) Eventually I think it would be nice to
be able to play the music that A+ and I might
want to sing to. It seems to be my current
hyperfocus. I enjoy spending the time
practising, knowing that there's no way to
skip that part (and perhaps this is even
supposed to be the fun part).</li>
<li>For singing, I can be mystified by all the
weird movements that I have to figure out in
my larynx and my diaphragm and other parts I
haven't even figured out how to name yet, much
less activate. It gives me some empathy for
how kids are learning about things we can't
easily teach them.</li>
<li>For drawing, I can be amused by the gap
between how things really are and how I
imagine them to be, and the gap between what I
imagine and what I can draw. The video
tutorial assures me that taking the time to
slow down and shade or add texture is
worthwhile, and is even the fun part of
drawing. I still get impatient occasionally
(do I really want to spend all this time on
one sketch?), but it's an interesting
perspective. I think it might be nice to
develop art into a relaxing activity. If I go
through the steps, I'll probably get there.
Also, I like doodling to break up the wall of text
in a blog post like this one, so that's another fun way to practice.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
So maybe I can be a bit more conscientious when
it's something I'm curious about or care about.

<p>
For the tasks that I need to be conscientious
about, there are other things that help:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm getting better at accepting my limits. For
example, when I had a pie in the oven last
night, I told A+ that I couldn't go off to play
Minecraft with her because I might forget about
the pie and accidentally undercook or overcook it.</li>

<li>Writing notes helps me keep track of where I am,
what I wanted to do next, what I'm figuring out
along the way, and so on. The possibility of
sharing those notes (and thus having more
opportunities to learn from my past self or from
other people) also encourages me to get to a
point where those notes can be shared. Here I
really appreciate how <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a> helps me capture,
manage, and post my tasks and notes, thanks to
literate programming. People occasionally tell
me that they think I'm very organized, but
that's probably just because I write about stuff
so that when I forget, I can look them up again.</li>

<li>Checklists are also handy. Most of the time, I
just make a checklist on my phone using <a href="https://www.orgzlyrevived.com/">Orgzly
Revived</a>, but maybe I can make these more visual.
I notice that I'm not particularly influenced by
the gamification strategy of a <abbr title="number of continuous days that gets reset to 1 when you miss a day" tabindex="0">streak count</abbr>
 and mildly influenced by <abbr title="experience point" tabindex="0">XP</abbr> bars.</li>

<li>Journal entries and blog posts also give me a
record of what I've worked on, and even little
bits of progress accumulate.</li>

<li>I'm also learning to to distract the
fidgety part of my brain with music or
movement, and to manage it with timers. Timers
are great. Timers to get started, timers to
check in with myself, timers to come back&#x2026;</li>

<li>Automation is wonderful. Getting a computer to
do the work is often more fun and less
error-prone than my doing it myself. Even
semi-automation is helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Despite not thinking of myself as particularly
conscientious, I'm pretty happy with what I've
been figuring out about my life and the world. I
can think of how I work as building on my
strengths instead of just working around my
weaknesses. I enjoy learning about and dabbling in
lots of different interests, and the combination of
ideas can be very useful (like <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-10-dancer-curiosity-style-wikipedia-browsing.html">dancer curiosity</a>).
Framing many decisions as experiments helps me get
to 80%-fine quickly, and I don't spend a
lot of time chasing down that last 20% that takes
most of the effort. I don't fit the hustle culture
of many self-help books, blogs, and videos, and
that's okay.

<p>
I think my dad was not particulary conscientious
either, at least not in terms of planning ahead,
paying attention to details, following
conventions. He was always in motion, happiest
whenever he had a crazy project. Fortunately, he
was really good at inspiring other people to
handle the logistics. He came up with the ideas
("I want to fly across the Philippines in an
ultralight") and people like my mom figured out
how (fuel, landing spots, etc.). His spontaneous
road trips drove me a little batty when I was a
kid. But also, when it came to the things he cared
about, he could spend hours, days, weeks on
getting it right. I remember how he'd stay up
late to figure something out, whether it was
digital photography or Microsoft 3D Pinball. I've
written about how he repeatedly drew variations on
the same sketch in order to figure out what he
wanted. He did okay. He found his way, even though
it looked nothing at all like the standard paths.
I'm probably doing all right, too.
</p>

<p>
My mom was more conscientious and deliberate than
my dad was. She handled the business while my dad
got to focus on his passions. From her, I picked
up the habits of reading and writing. I think I'd
like to be more of a mix between their styles
rather than one or the other.

Apparently, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2562318/">conscientiousness tends to increase
with age</a>, so that's interesting. I feel slower
when it comes to some things (probably because of
adapting to all those distractions and periods of
sleep deprivation, or maybe age, or simply a more
realistic evaluation of my abilities), so it's
easier to give myself time to do things that are
slow. Maybe I'll get better at enjoying the act of
practising and paying attention to the details.
I'll probably benefit from more orderliness, too.
I wonder how I can get my brain to enjoy
decluttering and figuring out the right homes for
objects. It's a little like preparing the space so
that I can see what I like and it's easy to work
on what I enjoy. (Marie Kondo's <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/books">The Life-Changing
Magic of Tidying Up</a> might be relevant here,
although even she has found keeping a tidy house
with kids to be a challenge&#x2026;)

<p>
When I first became a mother, I felt frustrated when I couldn’t tidy my home exactly the way I wanted. Then, I had two more children, and I found I didn’t even have the energy to consider some of my former practices around the house!
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, here are some tips that help me keep my home in order with two young children.
</p>

<p>
Motherhood has taught me to be more forgiving of myself. The joy that comes from parenting exceeds any satisfaction that could have come from a perfectly neat home. My children also remind me that our lives can shift daily (if not every minute) — and that the best we can do is honor where we are in the present moment.

I've been trying to think of a neutral or
positively-coded word for the opposite of the
conscientiousness personality trait. I asked
Claude AI to generate a bunch of antonyms. I don't
quite identify with "free-spirited" or
"spontaneous", but I like "adaptable" and
"improvisational," and "interest-driven" is an
accurate description of the way we spend our
energy. Those words don't quite cover the same
cluster of meanings that "conscientious" does, but
they give me other ways to think about the
personality trait as something more positive.

I'm always curious about how I can work with what
I've got. New challenges, new experiences, new
capabilities&#x2026; I get to learn even more about how
my brain works and what I can do, especially as I
build systems and processes to support myself.
</p>

<p>
Figuring out more about building on my strengths
will also help me parent A+, so this work is extra
worth it. I can even learn from the worries that
sometimes flutter up when I see her also wandering
far from what the school system would probably
prefer that she focus on.

Thinking about processes and tools and
self-acceptance also makes me think a little about
Andy's recent blog post <a href="https://plaindrops.de/blog/2025/tenyearsofemacs/">My 10 Years with Emacs</a>, in
which (among other thoughts about what he's
learned about using Emacs and other people he
wants to thank for helping) he mentions thinking
of me as kind of the community mom. I was 18 when
I started using Emacs, I've grown up in this
community, and I've got blog posts and videos that
help me catch glimpses of myself throughout the
years. It does feel interesting to notice the
shifts in my brain, from kind of an enthusiastic
puppy bursting with energy to something more about
experimentation, reflection, and connection. If I
can get better at understanding myself and the
tools I can build to support who I am and what I
want to do, I wonder if that'll help other people
too. I'm looking forward to being able to someday
bring grandparent energy to this. What could that
be like? There are people even older than I am in
this community, which is wonderful. I'm looking
forward to seeing how we all figure out how to
work with what we've got.
