Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
We come to you bearing many things.  
Some are burdens, but others are idols:
</p>

 <p>
The idol of superiority,
</p>

 <p>
The idol of certainty,
</p>

 <p>
The idol of believing that   
we are the gatekeepers to your kingdom,
</p>

 <p>
The idol of making the gospel   
an object of mere belief,  
and not a way of life.
</p>

 <p>
But when the burdens are lifted,  
and the idols are destroyed,  
What remains is truly precious:
</p>

 <p>
Women and men in community,  
Gifted people of all ages  
working together so that  
your kingdom may come,  
and your will be done  
even here, even now.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
