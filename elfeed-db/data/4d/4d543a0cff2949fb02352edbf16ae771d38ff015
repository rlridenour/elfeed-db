The best sermons open our eyes to present realities, give us hope for a future in the Kingdom, and challenge us to move forward into that future. Yesterday’s sermon by Mitch Randall​ at NorthHaven Church​ was certainly one of those. Here is the prayer for the week:
</p>

 <p>
God of Justice,
</p>

 <p>
In 1961, <br></br>
the Freedom Riders <br></br>
were beaten with pipes <br></br>
after their bus was bombed <br></br>
in a terrorist act.
</p>

 <p>
I, Lord, would never <br></br>
have swung a pipe in anger.
</p>

 <p>
Fifty-four years later, <br></br>
those on another bus <br></br>
shout ugly chants to <br></br>
reinforce a false <br></br>
sense of superiority.
</p>

 <p>
I, Lord, would have refused <br></br>
to utter the reprehensible words.
</p>

 <p>
Instead, Lord, <br></br>
I am the one <br></br>
who stands in silence, <br></br>
and does nothing, <br></br>
but enables everything.
</p>

 <p>
Lord have mercy <br></br>
on my <br></br>
apathetic, <br></br>
indifferent, <br></br>
lukewarm <br></br>
soul.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
