There are circumstances during which my failure becomes clearly evident, and the events of the past few days have given me needed opportunity to reflect on that failure.
</p>

 <p>
God’s commandment is to love — a commandment given not to an abstract entity such as government or the church, but a commandment given to me.
</p>

 <p>
Even more, God commanded me to love my neighbor — not the world or humanity, but my neighbor, the one who weeps in fear and pain, the one who offends me, the one with whom I disagree, and the one of whom I take no notice.
</p>

 <p>
May God have mercy on me, a sinner.
</p>

 <p>
God who sustains us,
</p>

 <p>
If we are to rejoice together, <br></br>
may we taste the strength <br></br>
of your justice and peace. <br></br></p>

 <p>
If we are to suffer together, <br></br>
may we drink deeply <br></br>
from your sacred tears. <br></br></p>

 <p>
If we are to live together, <br></br>
may we feast on your love, <br></br>
knowing that there is one rule <br></br>
at the table of the Lord:
</p>

 <p>
“Little children, love one another.”
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
