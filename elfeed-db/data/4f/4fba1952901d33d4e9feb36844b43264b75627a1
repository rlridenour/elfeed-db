Hearing the sermon on Sunday, then reading Abraham Joshua Heschel on Monday and Flannery O’Connor on Tuesday – they all seemed to be speaking the same thing to me. This week’s prayer:
</p>

 <p>
Lord,
</p>

 <p>
I feel the weight of my choices, <br></br>
bearing down upon my conscience, <br></br>
each one a testimony to the truth <br></br>
that those who do evil <br></br>
have their greatest allies <br></br>
in those who do nothing.
</p>

 <p>
The burden of freedom is this, <br></br>
though only some are guilty, <br></br>
we are all surely responsible.
</p>

 <p>
We ask not that this burden <br></br>
be taken from us, but instead, <br></br>
that we bear it with more <br></br>
than the empty thoughts and prayers <br></br>
of those who just pass by, <br></br>
but with the grace and love <br></br>
of the Samaritan <br></br>
that leads to action.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
