<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
An ongoing reflection of #books that have stayed with me. In which #libraries are spaces for reflection and rest; themselves housing a mixture of memories. All triggered by a quest for a “Little Known” essay and touching again a book I once had checked out and read.

<p>Having written
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2024/12/27/twenty-books-that-have-stayed-with-me/">Twenty Books that Have Stayed With Me</a></cite>, and not including <cite data-id="69543A7D-BDE9-4783-8D59-C71003467C20">Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</cite> by Annie Dillard, I feel as though I missed something. The winnowing exercise
of picking 20 is akin to asking which organs are your favorite. I need most all
of them.</p>
<p>Memories of <cite data-id="69543A7D-BDE9-4783-8D59-C71003467C20">Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</cite> book seeped deeper than I consciously
thought. Even typing the title, I see a young woman, fluttering through a
primal landscape. An inquisitive explorer of both land and soul. One eager to
find her place by drinking of the surrounding poetry.</p>
<p>But I struggle to recall much more. It is as though that recounted year at the
creek has composted into the loam that is my essence; now part of the gnarled
admixture of roots and soil that is me. And in that richness resides another of
my not listed yet influential books: <cite data-id="472C1DBD-E0EB-4510-96D4-E474DF0C313E">Siddhartha</cite> by Herman Hesse.</p>
<p><cite data-id="472C1DBD-E0EB-4510-96D4-E474DF0C313E">Siddhartha</cite> tracks the religious/spiritual life time trajectory of the main
character, whereas <cite data-id="69543A7D-BDE9-4783-8D59-C71003467C20">Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</cite> by Annie Dillard explores the pilgrim’s year amongst
nature. I suspect one contains the other; but I’m uncertain which.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-01-03" title="2025-01-03">This past Friday</time> serendipity brought a gift.</p>
<p>I had a few free hours and chose to visit the Goshen Public Library.<small class="side-container">
<span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
<span class="side" role="note"> Whenever I travel, I make it a habit to visit local book stores and local
libraries. I cannot express to you the joy of discovering the curatorial
conversation shared through their respective collections.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
In my
rucksack, I have a book, journal, and laptop. I was going to enjoy an afternoon
of reading and writing in one of my favorite public spaces. My quest, to find
an essay.</p>
<p>I had read <time datetime="2025-01-03" title="2025-01-03">earlier that morning</time> <a href="https://electricliterature.com/what-a-little-known-ursula-k-le-guin-essay-taught-me-about-being-a-woman/">What a Little-Known Ursula K. Le Guin Essay
Taught Me About Being a Woman</a>, a blog post by Emily Popek.<small class="side-container">
<span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
<span class="side" role="note"> I am certain that I have the book that contains the essay. And I’m also
certain that it is packed up at the moment.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
And thought the
library might have that “Little Known” essay. I walked from our store to the
library, careful of the forming ice as winter again took hold.</p>
<p>As I approached the entrance, two women, several small children, and a cloud of
joy burst from the doors. Their cloths ill-suited for the blustering cold, yet
undeterred. I noticed they each shifted their walking style as only those that
have walked on ice know to do. Firmly planting one foot before moving another;
a learned reflex.</p>
<p>I smiled seeing another generation playful as they exited the library. I could
see in those moments that they had felt the enduring freedom of a place that
lives to the ideals of what is etched at the foot of Ellis Island’s monument.</p>
<p>I walked past them, giving space for children a glow with energy to play,
shiver, and stomp in snow; even though their hands lacked gloves and their shoes
were that mesh that lets all moisture seep into your socks, bringing about a
chill that takes my aging bones far longer to overcome.</p>
<p>I grabbed that biting cold door handle and pulled my way into the vestibule. To
my right I saw the familiar cart loaded with free items: audio books, COVID
tests, magazines, discarded paper and hardbacks.</p>
<p>I always check what’s on offer. This time I found that they were culling a copy
of <cite data-id="F941B885-3560-42F7-91A9-B01DCDF4772B">Teaching a Stone to Talk</cite> by Annie Dillard. Reaching for that book, I felt memories stir. I
had previously checked out this particular copy. And now it was my turn to
steward it along its journey.</p>
<p>Standing in the space between out of doors and library proper, I opened to the
first essay and saw <em>Total Eclipse</em>; my pulse quickened. <time datetime="2018" title="2018">Several years ago</time>, I had
first read <em>Total Eclipse</em>. The description of the arrival and passing of a
total eclipse etched into my memory.</p>
<p>Dillard described an otherworldly event, capturing the haunting discomfort and
rare beauty; as though shifting elsewhere: to an old Star Trek alien landscape.
One familiar only in that the stage of an old show is set invariably on our
Earth.</p>
<p>In <time datetime="2024" title="2024">2024</time> I witnessed a total eclipse, and the like named essay reinforces my
memories, reverberating with such crystalline clarity. I thought to myself: an
auspicious moment, to have re-found an essay that I think about more often than
the Roman empire.</p>
<p>While not a questing beast but instead a talisman, this book helped reinforce a
personal aspiration for <time datetime="2025" title="2025">the year</time>: I’m aiming to read one essay and poem each
day. And also read at least one chapter of fiction. And continue writing both
publicly and privately.</p>
<p>I’ve found myself over the years yearning to write, as though a plant seeking to
burst from beneath the boundary of soil and sky. Reading is often a gentle rain
seeping into my writing plant’s hosting soil; making possible growth. Though
some reads unleash with a fury, but I think I’m well rooted to receive even
their harshest downpour.</p>
<p>As I went from the vestibule of the library into the entry area I looked and saw
that one display was highlighting small but mighty non-fiction. Resting on the
shelf was <cite data-id="0374564B-160C-44AF-BE7F-6096B63B8A31">Steering the Craft</cite> by Ursula K. Le Guin. I smiled knowing that I own a copy but that its currently
packed up.</p>
<p>I grabbed the book, primed and thinking about that blog post and “Little Known”
essay.</p>
<p>I started querying the catalog, missing the tactile interaction with the old
wooden analogue. Those old card catalogs, made of the stuff of books,
themselves holding the stuff of books, pointing to their brethren. All serving
an afterlife of carrying words forward into time and space.</p>
<p>Instead of wood, I queried a course through lighting and melted sand. There
were several non-fiction books by Le Guin; and they were to be found in the 814
section of the library (<abbr title="example given">e.g.</abbr>
, Essays).</p>
<p>With my north star shining I walked back to the 814s. Enroute I looked around
at a library full of a myriad of patrons, each setting at private desks
engrossed in their endeavors. This was a time when school was in recess and
even many of the local factories were in their winter shutdown.</p>
<p>I rummaged and ransacked the shelf, grabbing a stack of essay books and
retreating to a private desk; one of those with foot tall privacy walls doubling
as boundaries between neighboring patrons. As though two patrons in their
literary journey might raise their voice saying “Dad, they’re on my side again.”</p>
<p>I doffed my coat setting it on the chair and my rucksack and essay hoard down on
the table. My initial intentions evaporating as I looked upon a myriad of
books. I set about intent on flipping through the table of contents of each
before picking an essay.</p>
<p>I aborted my plan at my first book: <cite data-id="7EAE1522-17EB-421C-9C7D-92FB442BFD53">Ursula K. Le Guin</cite> by Ursula K. Le Guin and David Naimon. The introduction hit me in the
feels. The editor/interviewer spoke of learning about the death of Le Guin
while in the final stages of their back and forth refining of what would be the
published book.</p>
<p>Tears welled up as reminder of all we’d lost during an era of non-grieving; one
that looms again heavy rancorous clouds on the near horizon. Towering and
menacing as it once did in a town hall <time datetime="2016-10-09" title="2016-10-09">some 8 years ago</time>.</p>
<p>The book’s introduction drew me in, but I realized I wouldn’t be able to finish
it during this sitting. I didn’t think I’d have time nor emotional space to
feel like I could truly engage with these near final words of an author I so
very much admire.</p>
<p>I had wanted Le Guin, but I also wanted to write in the margins. I’d written in
library books before, but chose to abstain. I thought to my books currently
packed and chose others at the desk on which to graze. So as not to forget, I
wrote it down adding <cite data-id="7EAE1522-17EB-421C-9C7D-92FB442BFD53">Ursula K. Le Guin</cite> to my shopping list.</p>
<p>I then picked up <cite data-id="141FCE46-57A7-4DB7-8635-C4CA142ACAD7">and yet&hellip;</cite> by Christopher Hitchens. A
memory flickered of a friend’s thoughtful adoration around Hitchens’s essays. I
began thumbing through the table of contents, and I found <cite data-id="FA92DCBF-1571-436C-94B0-AEEAE267FFE2">The Importance of Being Orwell</cite>. Having recently read <cite data-id="FB27689F-EFB6-4C17-A9B9-D4759FC2572F">Why Orwell Matters</cite> by Christopher Hitchens, I thought to follow that thread; one must’ve preceded the other.</p>
<p>My notes are as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="h-cite">
Orwell was always investigating primary sources; writing and changing his
opinions. He was “prescient” at how neologisms developed and were used to
control narratives. I must read his essays.
</blockquote>
<p>I knew that as I grabbed those essays, I’d invariably be adding to my shopping
list. <cite data-id="141FCE46-57A7-4DB7-8635-C4CA142ACAD7">and yet&hellip;</cite> joined the fray alongside Orwell’s essays, which already
were on the list.</p>
<p>Following threads and holding space for serendipity has lead to some interesting
moments; allowing my brain to wander. One curiosity has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist)">John Brown</a>.</p>
<p>In one of those “adhering to intention” mornings at the start of the <time datetime="2025" title="2025">new year</time>, I
grabbed a book of poetry and started reading <cite data-id="010F83F9-835C-4893-A741-BF503018C053">The Portent</cite> by Herman Mellville.
The next day, I pulled <cite data-id="A2EDEF3B-FDF9-4076-B69A-8C4183A40C71">The Essential Muriel Rukeyser</cite> from the shelf and
flipped at random to the <cite data-id="FA07012E-D964-4E0D-8173-60ECD021AEBB">The Soul and Body of John Brown</cite>.</p>
<p>Leaving me to wonder, how many poems (and essays) might there be about John
Brown? Just <time datetime="2025-01-05" title="2025-01-05">last night</time> I found another one lurking in my just thrifted copy of
<cite data-id="88939149-5b40-4121-a974-bf8d4cf7125e">The Poetry of E.A. Robinson</cite>. There are certainly a few more packed away and
now I’d be questing for more.</p>
<p>But back to that library, with not a John Brown in sight; at least not in my
quick scan of these 814s’s tables of contents.<small class="side-container">
<span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
<span class="side" role="note"> Though I didn’t check their indices.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
</p>
<p>I chose then to continue my grazing, though pushing aside the heaping helpings
of Le Guin. During my ransacking, I had grabbed a front-facing book: <cite data-id="43473E39-7882-4067-99D0-C1C947E42194">A Literary Education and Other Essays</cite> by Joseph Epstein. I was curious, as I
feel an ever present thirst to drink deeper for/of my “Literary Education.”</p>
<p>Thumbing through the table of contents I found <cite data-id="E38741C3-A8A0-499F-8B60-C2238D514D58">The Death of Liberal Arts</cite>. I
cherish my liberal arts education. I have also worked at a university with a
large Arts &amp; Letters college, but which favors football programs, producing
business majors, and religious legal ideologues. So I thought this essay could
provide insights into an observed malaise.</p>
<p>Which echoes a conversation my partner and I have had. We think that we were
present just past the cresting zenith of the public school experiment. She
being just a bit older may have been at the zenith. We had ample recess,
minimal homework, and even computer programming classes in elementary school. I
learned to sew and cook in school, do my taxes, and create a formal letter.</p>
<p>Here are my notes from <cite data-id="E38741C3-A8A0-499F-8B60-C2238D514D58">The Death of Liberal Arts</cite>:</p>
<blockquote class="h-cite">
<p>Reading [<cite data-id="E38741C3-A8A0-499F-8B60-C2238D514D58">The Death of Liberal Arts</cite>] essay, I nodded along with the observed
erosion of liberal arts. However, as I finished nodding one passage struck as a
disgruntled Boomer that made fun of Millenials who didn’t know how to cook. The
Millenials didn’t know how to cook because the Boomers failed to teach cooking.</p>
<p>That’s somewhat harsh, but the tones I got were of one who wanted to sustain the
past systems; that we are where we are at because of our historic corpus and
that should be sustained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That passage “we are where we are at because of our historic corpus” is an echo
of something I previously read, which I failed to jot down but am instead trying
to remember. In rough approximation it is: there is an extreme and obvious
disconnect between where we are at and the history that espouses to describe how
we got to where we are at.</p>
<p>Orwell’s <cite data-id="D8C4A544-993C-4C20-AB42-237267FAE4B4">1984</cite> has something to say about that: “Who controls the past,
controls the future: who controls the present, controls the past.”</p>
<p>That essay stuck, as though a popcorn kernel between two molars. I picked at it
with my tongue as I jumped to a book that piqued my inner philosopher: <cite data-id="0EEB1AF1-65B3-477B-AB67-96BFED263AD0">Kant&rsquo;s Little Prussian Head and Other Reasons Why I Write</cite> by Claire Messud. Again, I looked to the
table of contents and saw a trio of essays related to Albert Camus:</p>
<ul>
<li><cite data-id="28E0EDDF-17A8-42A0-8DC5-663529DC34E6">Camus and Algeria</cite></li>
<li><cite data-id="901AB0A6-EA1B-4F92-B70B-368FBEBB57F3">A New L’Étranger</cite></li>
<li><cite data-id="1C15F270-A2D7-4BD0-8EAE-2A827438AC79">The Brother of the Stranger</cite></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes please, I thought to myself as I turned to the first essay. My notes from
those three are as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="h-cite">
<p>In <cite data-id="28E0EDDF-17A8-42A0-8DC5-663529DC34E6">Camus and Algeria</cite>, the essay helped me understand
Camus’s written position regarding the independence of Algeria; namely that
there must be space for the colonizers (now generations established as the only
home they know) as well as full and sincere reparations for the colonized. This
helps untarnish the “smears” I’ve read regarding Camus.</p>
<p><cite data-id="901AB0A6-EA1B-4F92-B70B-368FBEBB57F3">A New L’Étranger</cite> by Claire Messud has me reconsidering the translation I might
read; namely to read Sandra Smith’s.</p>
<p>And last is <cite data-id="1C15F270-A2D7-4BD0-8EAE-2A827438AC79">The Brother of the Stranger</cite>, which highlights a book
I recently picked up <cite data-id="51F00956-3C7E-4589-AAA3-C972988D158D">The Meursault Investigation</cite> by Kamel Daoud and the pains
of post-colonial Algeria which has made “strangers” of many.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added <cite data-id="0EEB1AF1-65B3-477B-AB67-96BFED263AD0">Kant&rsquo;s Little Prussian Head and Other Reasons Why I Write</cite> to my
shopping list and started wrapping up. The final essay of <time datetime="2025-01-03" title="2025-01-03">that day</time> being a
reminder to get back to reading <cite data-id="51F00956-3C7E-4589-AAA3-C972988D158D">The Meursault Investigation</cite>.</p>
<p>These five essays (and one introduction) had formed a river, carrying me
through a multitude. And as I assemble this narrative stone by stone, I am
thankful for my
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2019/05/19/reading-challenges/">Reading Challenges</a></cite>, as it (along with many other activities)
equipped me to read more critically.</p>
<p>While packing up, I revisited the needling nagging passage in Epstein’s essay
and sought more information regarding Epstein. Here are my notes from that
search:</p>
<blockquote class="h-cite">
Looking to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Epstein_(writer)">Wikipedia</a>, he’s a bigot [homophobe and mysoginist]. So fuck right
off. Two controversies: one regarding homosexuality and two dismissing Dr. Jill
Biden’s doctorate and honorific. What a turd.
</blockquote>
<p>With sunlight starting to fade I put Epstein’s book back on the shelf; not in
its front-facing position, but instead more modest in showing its spine along
side its alphabetical neighbors.<small class="side-container">
<span class="side-label"><span class="hidden">(</span>Sidenote<span class="hidden">:</span></span>
<span class="side" role="note"> Normally, I’ll leave books out for refiling by the library staff.<span class="hidden">)</span></span>
</small>
I then grabbed an on-the-shelf book of Le
Guin essays and put it front-facing.</p>
<p>The other books I left for re-shelving, my understanding being that this helps
with gleaning some non-circulating insights into selected books. Walking
through the library, in which I’m now a non-resident patron, I started zipping
up my winter coat and securing my rucksack.</p>
<p>I’ve walked it many times, but it was my first exit since moving away from its
district.</p>
<p>This library is where, having moved into town at the start of 7th grade, I got
my first “I can check out grown-up books” library card. I spent many summer
nights reading Forgotten Realms novels that I’d checked out from the library.</p>
<p>This library is named in my will as one of the benefactors (were my partner and
all of my children to proceed me in death). A contingency I hadn’t really
considered until the Covid-19 Pandemic took hold.</p>
<p>The Goshen Public Library is where I’d taken my children to get books and videos
for the week. It was where they too got their first library card that allowed
them to checkout “grown-up books.”</p>
<p>One particular visit many years ago, I had attached the child ride along to my
bike. My two then young daughters rode in the back, and my son pedaled along on
his bike.</p>
<p>We biked the mile from our ranch-style house to the library, traveling along a
pathway through a wetland and park; a major artery of both traffic and
watershed. The girls were just a bit too much for the ride along, but we made
it work.</p>
<p>We spent an hour or so at the library; listening to story time, playing with the
gigantic chess set, the three coordinating amongst themselves the 5 videos we’d
all checkout.</p>
<p>As we were packing up to return, I noticed that the winds had changed. A storm
was coming in; the clouds were heavy and I could feel the pull of air as though
sucking in a breath to blow out an septuagenarian’s conflagration of birthday
candles.</p>
<p>We peddled frantically to beat the rains. My unencumbered son easily keeping
pace as we raced home. We peddled down the pathway to the wetland area, then
climbed up and hit headwinds. The children were all cheering at this lived
moment.</p>
<p>As we turned onto our street I told my son to scurry ahead and open the garage.</p>
<p>He rose off his bike seat, stepping hard, and sped ahead. As I drew closer I
saw the garage opening, and heard the woosh of heavy rains drawing closer. I
turned onto our driveway, and we screeched to a stop in the garage just as
heaven opened upon our drive way then roof and soon all was driving rain.</p>
<p>And <time datetime="2025-01-03" title="2025-01-03">now</time>, as I stepped through that vestibule out into the cold, I pulled on my
gloves and looked upon a winter-scape: one cold with a fresh covering snow. And
I knew that treachery lurked beneath it all and adjusted my stride.</p>
<p>This moment held the promise that all too soon we would join the cold thaw,
seeking creek then river then ocean, ever rising into heaven and falling once
more.</p>
