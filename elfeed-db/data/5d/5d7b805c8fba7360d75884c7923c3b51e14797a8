God of creation,
</p>

 <p>
You gave us our first breath, <br></br>
Raised us up as we took our first feeble steps, <br></br>
Walked with us through the valleys of darkness, <br></br>
Comforted us during the times of loss, <br></br>
And you will welcome us into your arms when we pass from this life. <br></br> <br></br>
Today we remember those who have gone before, <br></br>
Those who have given their lives for their country’s sake, <br></br>
Those who sacrificed their own comfort so that others may prosper, <br></br>
And those who have cried out with our Lord from Gethsemane: <br></br>
“Not my will, but thine be done.” <br></br> <br></br> <br></br>
And so, <br></br>
Gracious God, <br></br>
We ask for strength, <br></br>
So that we may live lives <br></br>
Worthy of those who have gone before. <br></br> <br></br>
And may you accept the gifts we offer <br></br>
As a material symbol of a spiritual sacrifice, <br></br>
the sacrifice of our very lives. <br></br> <br></br>
For they are already yours, <br></br>
Redeemed by the shed blood and broken body <br></br>
Of our Lord Jesus Christ, <br></br>
In whose name we pray. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
