As a blog platform, Jekyll has a number of positive features: 
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>The speed and security of a static site,</li>
 <li>The convenience and future-proofing of plain text, and most importantly for educators,</li>
 <li>Free hosting on GitHub.</li>
</ol> <p>
For me, the one drawback has been finding a convenient way to post using my iPad. There are a number of good Markdown editors for iOS, so writing posts is very easy, but publishing them can be a challenge.
  <a href="https://appsto.re/us/xONC1.i">Working Copy</a> works well to manage the Git repository, but it doesn’t have the convenience that I wanted, and I really don’t need to store my whole Jekyll repository on the iPad.
 I can post using  <a href="https://appsto.re/us/PTVR2.i">Prompt 2</a> and my 
Linux server on  <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>.  Neither of these are the simple write-and-post workflows that the iPad calls for, though.

Yesterday, I found this  <a href="http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5838419494174720/XyeFJfsyXwE">workflow</a> by Max Jacobson. The first time it is run, it takes you to GitHub to generate an access token. After giving it the access token, the workflow will generate a file name in the correct format, prepare a commit message, and push the post to GitHub. <sup> <a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></p>

 <p>
Now, I’m one step closer to being able to use the iPad as a desktop replacement.

I did have to slightly modify the workflow by changing the “Request commit message from user” step to require a single line entry.
