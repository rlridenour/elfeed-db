This prayer is from 2014, but somehow seems fitting again this year:
</p>

 <p>
Gracious God,
</p>

 <p>
In the events of this year, <br></br>
we see how fragile our lives truly are.
</p>

 <p>
Daily, we are faced with a choice <br></br>
to be people who live in cynicism and despair, <br></br>
or people who live in gratitude and thanksgiving.
</p>

 <p>
On this day, we choose gratitude over despair, <br></br>
and lift our hearts in thanksgiving to you, <br></br>
the one who is the source of all good things.
</p>

 <p>
Thank you <br></br>
for family and friends, <br></br>
for life and for love, <br></br>
and for the beauty that we would see <br></br>
if we would just open our eyes to you.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
