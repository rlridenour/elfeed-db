I’m sitting in the USO at the Portland airport with some time to write the prayer for the week. The week of 9/11 is always a time of reflection for me. In past years, I’ve generally thought about the cost to military families, compared to a country that mostly feels inconvenienced at the airport. This year, I thought instead about the wonderful friends I made during two deployments. Although I do wish that the conflict had never happened, those friends are gifts from God that I will always cherish.

This week’s prayer:
</p>

 <p>
Thank you for <br></br>
the precious ones <br></br>
who walk through <br></br>
the valleys with us, <br></br>
surrounding us <br></br>
with your love, <br></br>
and reminding us <br></br>
that your grace can <br></br>
redeem every moment.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
