Over at the Emacs subreddit, Hungry-Accountant-99 has an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1j4370o/loving_emacs_writing_studio/">interesting post</a> about Peter Prevos&rsquo; Emacs Writing Studio (EWS). I&rsquo;ve written about EWS before [<a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=11646">1</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12086">2</a>, <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12417">3</a>] and have always found it an interesting project. Prevos gave a <a href="https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/writing/">talk at EmacsConf 2024</a> in which he discusses EWS and the book that he wrote describing it. Naturally, the book was written using EWS.

<p>
The idea of EWS is, to quote Prevos, that it&rsquo;s an Emacs configuration for people who want to work <i>with</i> Emacs not <i>on</i> Emacs. Almost every Emacs user will understand the distinction. Most of us can happily spend hours fiddling around with our Emacs configurations. Prevos is writing for people who just want to <i>use</i> Emacs and not spend time configuring it or even learning how to configure it.

EWS is set up so that writers can just write their text and let Emacs take care of the mechanics. The idea is to write in Org mode and then export to whatever format you need. That&rsquo;s the normal Org mode workflow, of course, but the idea of EWS is that it just works out of the box.

I haven&rsquo;t read the book—I just found out about it—but I have watched the video and can recommend it. Its only 13 and a half minutes so you should be able to fit it in fairly easily. I&rsquo;m planning on reading the book too. If you want to get a good idea about what the book is like, take a look at Hungry-Accountant-99&rsquo;s post. He gives a good review of the book.
