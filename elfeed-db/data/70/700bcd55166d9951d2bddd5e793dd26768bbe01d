This week’s prayer is simple, but informed by events of the week that profoundly impacted me. First, NorthHaven Church​ was in the area that sustained some wind damage in Wednesday night’s storm. The next day, Imam Imad Enchassi​ of the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City graciously asked if we needed any help. To all our Muslim friends,  <i>As-Salaam-Alaikum</i>.

Second, I see in my students a level of spiritual depth that I certainly did not have in my 20’s and may not yet have in my 50’s — one that moves beyond the superficial trivialities that pass for spirituality in much of American religion, but instead shows a deep understanding of the message of Jesus.

 <p>
Gracious and Loving God,
</p>

 <p>
Thank you for those moments <br></br>
when grace breaks in <br></br>
to interrupt our lives <br></br>
in surprising ways, <br></br>
and unexpected voices <br></br>
teach us once again <br></br>
what it means <br></br>
to follow Jesus.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
