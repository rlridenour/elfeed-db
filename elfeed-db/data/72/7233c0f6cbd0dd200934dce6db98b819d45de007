Gracious God, Giver of life,
</p>

 <p>
Long ago, <br></br>
a tree was planted by your grace <br></br>
and watered by your providential care.
</p>

 <p>
It was robbed of <br></br>
life and beauty, <br></br>
and used to fashion a cross <br></br>
to bear body of the Christ, <br></br>
broken for our redemption.
</p>

 <p>
And so, Lord, like that tree, <br></br>
we have been planted, <br></br>
watered, and have grown, <br></br>
yet the time has come for us <br></br>
to offer our lives to you, <br></br>
not just to bear, <br></br>
but to become <br></br>
the body of Christ <br></br>
in this world.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
