<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
A walk-through of the &ldquo;perks&rdquo; of using the #Elfeed #Emacs package for reading my #RSS feed. Then a quick overview of my back-up process, using habit stacking and #SyncThing. Finally, a reflection on what this is all meaning to me.

<p><small>I originally wrote this in my daily journal, but extracted it to a full post.
I’m nearing a point in writing where I need to consider how I might more easily
publish elements of my personal journal, while maintaining some as “too
private.” This is a significant deviation from my blogs current setup. Much to
consider, but what I have works, albeit with “friction”; a topic of the <a href="https://vhbelvadi.com/indieweb-carnival-friction">first
2025 IndieWeb Carnival “On the importance of friction”</a>.</small></p>
</aside>
<p>I’m smiling as I’m leaning into the robustness of the <span><a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">elfeed package</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “elfeed package”" title="Other site-wide references of “elfeed package”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ELFEED">&#128214;</a></small>
.</p>
<h2 id="re-introducing-elfeed">Re-Introducing Elfeed</h2>
<p><strong>First</strong>, I have an <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" title="Other site-wide references of “Rich Site Summary”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-RSS">&#128214;</a></small>
feed reader. In which the “news” rolls in according to
when it was published, not some capturing algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, as I encounter interesting links by feed entries, I can open them in
<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eww_(web_browser)">Emacs Web Wowser</a></span> (<abbr title="Emacs Web Wowser">EWW</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs Web Wowser”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs Web Wowser”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS-WEB-WOWSER">&#128214;</a></small>)
. From there, I give it a read and if I like the general disposition, I can
invoke <code>eww-copy-alternate-url</code> to see if there are alternate URLs (e.g. an <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>
feed). And add that to my list of feeds.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, as I read and want to comment, I invoke <code>org-store-link</code> which will copy
the entry’s URL and title. I start capturing my thoughts and invoke
<code>org-insert-link</code> to past the feed entry and title. This link type is <code>elfeed</code>.
Meaning when I click on the link, I’m taken to the cached <span>elfeed package</span>
version of that
entry.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I extended my <span>elfeed package</span>
link type export from <span><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-Mode</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" title="Other site-wide references of “Org-Mode”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-ORG-MODE">&#128214;</a></small>
to export the URL of
the feed item. Thus when I render my notes as <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Hypertext Markup Language”" title="Other site-wide references of “Hypertext Markup Language”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-HTML">&#128214;</a></small>
, the <span>elfeed package</span>
link types are
transformed to the well-known <code>http://…</code> format. I wrote about this feature in
<cite><a href="https://takeonrules.com/2024/08/11/exporting-org-mode-elfeed-links/">Exporting Org Mode Elfeed Links</a></cite>.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth</strong>, is the local cache/database of <span>elfeed package</span>
entries. All of those feed entries
that have scrolled through my reader. Those, in their full text, are stored
locally.<small class="side-container">

</small>
</p>
<p>They are available for offline reading, even years past having read them. And
I’ve treated these as important artifacts for me to “preserve.” And by that I
mean, make sure I have regular back-up copies of that information.</p>
<p>Let’s review that process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate an occasional copy of the cache.</li>
<li>Copy that copy to a few different devices.</li>

picking up a partially completed file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key in this is building the back-up process into a daily or thrice-daily ritual
of mine.</p>
<p>I accept that my back-up won’t be “immediately up to date” but in using this
process I can more reliably see when there are errors. That is I’m putting the
“logs” in a place visible during my ritual of reading my <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>
feed.</p>
<h3 id="copy-that-copy-to-a-few-different-devices">Copy That Copy to a Few Different Devices</h3>
<p>I setup <span>SyncThing</span>
on a few different devices. And the <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>
feed cache is sent to
those devices as “read only.” I don’t want to fuss with multiple devices having
conflicting versions of this canonical cache, hence writing them to the devices.</p>
<p>To restore from those backups, I’d unzip and <em>un-tar</em> the files. As there’s no
“operational urgency” to the backup, I’d restore at my leisure and then document
accordingly. In essence, reverse the process of the <span>Emacs</span>
function.</p>
<p>I’ve set my synchronization rules to only run when the devices are on the same
network.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I feel a contentedness of having a repository of things I’ve read (or at least
gathered) from the Internet. It is something that I should be able to easily
re-build were I to lose or replace my primary machine.</p>
<p>I’ve chosen to use <span>SyncThing</span>
instead of “pushing to the cloud” in part as a
low-stakes experiment on eschewing cloud storage.</p>
<p>Why? This little local archipelago I’m creating requires far less resources
than constantly syncing to a “remote” cloud. And I have more control over how
it’s used as well as how many copies are saved.</p>
<p>I’m also treating this as a small, concrete, yet reversible experiment with
cause for reflection. That is “how might I reduce my cloud storage footprint?”
And adjusting my relationship to “always available” versus “available upon
request.”</p>
<p>And here’s the realization: I don’t need much to always be available. And, with
the current process, there’s space to identify what I want available outside of
a tarball and thus “readable” on one of those other devices.</p>
<p>For example, I’ve shifted <a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs/blob/0f520ffb6d35e0c58ba995e80ea5811740bf108a/emacs.d/init.el#L4992-L5041">my Shopping List to write to that ready directory</a>, not
tarred and zipped, but as a plain text file. Which I can then read on my phone.</p>
<p>There’s more to think (and thus write) about in regards to how I’m thinking
about this <span>SyncThing</span>
ecosystem. But for now having a personal back-up is an
absolute reassuring joy.</p>
