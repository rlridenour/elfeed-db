Thank you, Lord, <br></br>
for showing us that <br></br>
the Gospel still speaks, <br></br>
that the Spirit still calls, <br></br>
and that people still respond,
</p>

 <p>
Today, it is one who, <br></br>
by the act of baptism, <br></br>
calls us to recover <br></br>
the excitement and hope <br></br>
of our first calling.
</p>

 <p>
As her faith grows, <br></br>
so may ours also.
</p>

 <p>
We can only dream of what <br></br>
you have in store for her, <br></br>
may the Church have the wisdom <br></br>
to at least not get in the way.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
