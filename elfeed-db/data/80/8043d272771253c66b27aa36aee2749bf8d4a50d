<li>Put stuff in them</li>
<li>Put them under your bed</li>
<li>Forget them and buy more stuff from us</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but they can hold a whole bunch of lemons and limes! (Do we recommend filling these with citrus and then stashing them under your bed? No. But the point stands: you <em>could</em>.)</li>
</ul><h1>Out of Sight</h1><p>We know how it is.</p>
<p>Day after a Meh-rathon. You just purchased so much bullshit. And then to top it off, you ordered the the big ol’ box of even more bullshit known as an Instant Regret Kit. Now, today, you’re in the throes of a commerce hangover, and all the great deals of yesterday are looking more like a great deal of stuff to find space for.</p>
<p>So, what should you do? Look yourself in the mirror? Ask yourself why? Start making changes? Teach yourself that retail therapy is all retail, zero therapy, and that if you keep going down this path, you could end up a cautionary tale, that weird aunt or uncle or cousin or coworker that everyone mocks behind their back before frowning and ending the story, “But it’s sad, really”?</p>
<p>Lol, no!</p>
<p>You just need to buy more stuff! Specifically, you need to buy things into which you can put all the other things you bought yesterday.</p>
<p>That’s what you get here: some underbed storage bags.</p>
<p>They’ve got more structure and appeal than a garbage bag, but they also have more give than a hard bin, so you can really shove them deep under your bed and forget all about them and their Meh-purchased contents, allowing you to buy more stuff with a clear conscience.</p>
<p>But, seriously, joking about your deal-habit aside, these things are just plain useful. You can use them under your bed–a place that otherwise will become an arena for dust bunny gladiatorial games–or you can stash them in the closet, the attic, the basement, wherever.</p>
<p>Also, they have clear plastic tops, so you can know, at a glance, what you’re pulling out. No need to open one up and realize what you thought were your fall sweaters is actually a tote of collected love letters from the one who got away, resulting in a spontaneous bout of ugly crying.</p>
<p>They’re good and useful, is what we’re saying. But don’t take our word for it. Last time we sold these, <a href="/@jjeanot">@jjeanot</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just got these and they are amazing! I can’t believe how much I fit into just one!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And remember, we’re talking about bags for putting under the bed here. Not exactly the sexiest product in the world, in other words. The fact that they inspired someone to come back and post a comment with not one but two exclamation points is saying something.</p>
<p>So buy them.</p>
