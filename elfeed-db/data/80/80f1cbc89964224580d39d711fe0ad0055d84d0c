<li>An interesting PDF reader. <a href="https://sioyek.info/" target="_blank">Sioyek</a></li>
<li>A Markdown Guide from the iA Writer folks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9PiNRSQ_BU" target="_blank">Writer 101 - Markdown Guide - YouTube</a></li>
<li>A customized version of Iosevka. Iosevka Output, a nice mono-spaced font. <a href="https://codeberg.org/ashton314/iosevka-output/releases" target="_blank">Releases - ashton314iosevka-output - Codeberg.org</a></li>
<li>Another good monospaced font. <a href="https://commitmono.com/" target="_blank">Commit Mono. Neutral programming typeface.</a></li>
<li>The thinking behind iA Writer changing its icon. <a href="https://ia.net/topics/making-icons-fresh" target="_blank">Making Icons Fresh</a>. Love the new icons.</li>
<li>Some people are nuts. But they are the good kind of nuts. <a href="https://skybert.net/mac-os-x/macos-as-unix-workstation-2022/" target="_blank">macOS as Unix Workstation 2022 skybert.net</a></li>
<li>I must admit that I have tried more solutions than those listed and have come to the same conclusion. <a href="https://macadie.info/2023/04/20/alternatives-to-org-that-i-will-not-be-using/" target="_blank">Alternatives to Org (that I will not be using) – MacAdie Web Blog</a></li>
<li>If your plain-text format of choice is Markdown, then this holds up pretty well. <a href="https://ldstephens.me/freedom-to-app-hop/" target="_blank">Freedom to App-Hop ldstephens</a>. <a href="https://baty.blog/2024/08/monday-august-12-2024" target="_blank">Jack Baty</a> is perfectly nutty. He switches between steep learning curve apps like Emacs and Tinderbox without a care. He is comfortable in them and slings them around for fun. Unfortunately, none of us are Jack Baty. If you are writing in Markdown there are a ton of applications which do a great job of providing you with the perfect writing environment and most of them you can learn how to use in an afternoon. If your preferred format is org, you have to deal with Emacs. And if you commit to Emacs, why would you use anything else? I was in the “Freedom to App-Hop” coalition till I turned to Org-mode and Emacs. Now I am not so sure.</li>
<li>The Archive is fantastic. <a href="https://v3.manankhattar.com/n/a-love-letter-to-the-archive/" target="_blank">A love letter to The Archive</a>. A sentiment well-expressed.</li>
