This blog is hosted on Github, and posting from iOS has been a challenge. I’m optimistic that things have become much easier with the release of  <a href="http://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a>, which is a Git client for iOS that can fetch, merge, and push to both Github and Bitbucket.
 I cloned my site repository to the iPad with Working Copy, created a new Markdown file, and opened the file in  <a href="http://bywordapp.com">Byword</a> with the iOS document picker. 
</p>

 <p>
In a moment, I will try to push the new file to the repository, and hope that a new post shortly appears.

UPDATE: Success! I like writing with  <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a>, but it can’t use the document picker. There is an Editorial workflow for Working Copy, but I haven’t tried it yet. Byword is working perfectly.
