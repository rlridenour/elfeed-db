A prayer prompted by praying with friends in Ghana who pray and give thanks for everything, from resting well through the night to waking up the next morning.
</p>

 <p>
Gracious God,
</p>

 <p>
As I begin the day, <br></br>
may I remember <br></br>
to trust in your grace <br></br>
for what I need, <br></br>
no matter how great, <br></br>
no matter how small.
</p>

 <p>
And as I end this day, <br></br>
may I remember to give thanks <br></br>
for what I have been given, <br></br>
no matter how great, <br></br>
no matter how small.
</p>

 <p>
For every good thing <br></br>
is a gift from you, <br></br>
and even a small gift <br></br>
is priceless when received <br></br>
from the hand of God.
</p>

 <p>
Amen
</p>
