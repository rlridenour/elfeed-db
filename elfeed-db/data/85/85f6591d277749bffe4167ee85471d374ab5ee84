It&rsquo;s that time of year again. Once again Irreal pays tribute to the greatest album of all time: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>. It&rsquo;s no secret that we here at Irreal are serious fans of Pink Floyd and their music. As I write this, it occurs to me that at 52, <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> is older than many Irreal readers and in some cases older than their parents. It&rsquo;s a tribute to the album that its appeal has lasted so long.

Every year I link to one of their songs that I really like. Originally, those songs were all from <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> but lately I&rsquo;ve been including songs from their other albums. This year I invite you to enjoy <i>One Slip</i> from the <i>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</i> album. That album gets its name from a line in <i>One Slip</i>.

It&rsquo;s a mysterious song that reminds me of Procol Harum&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Whiter_Shade_of_Pale">A Whiter Shade of Pale</a>. In both songs it&rsquo;s never entirely clear what the song is actually about. Here for your enjoyment is <i>One Slip</i>.
