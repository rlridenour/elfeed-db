<p>Overnight, with temperatures below zero and fog covering lake and field, the
trees donned crystalline robes. Now in morning sun they stand resplendent;
though dripping towards their nakedness.</p>
<p>The lake, again covered in snow, scatters sunlight for all who would bare
witness to its still frozen glory; soon its icy crown shall shrink and fade into

<p>In between now and then, we’ll sip coffee and do some household re-arranging:
shuffling some things to the basement, loading some recycling into the car,
tidying a counter-top overrun with indecision.</p>
<p>I again feel an urge to write and read; and a sense of “keep sorting the house.”</p>

<p>I recently picked up <cite data-id="4c1f3a6f-5f38-4592-ba9e-9bead5b53bcd">The Magpie at Night</cite> by Li Qingzhao. In the introduction,
the translator quotes a contemporary account of Li Qingzhao donning coat and
hat, heading out into the snowstorm, climbing the city walls and looking for
