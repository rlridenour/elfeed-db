<div class="verse">
<p>My children have all been born;<br />
Yet yours may not have yet.<br />
My children have fledged afield;<br />
Yet yours may not have yet.<br />
<br />
But I think of mine and them,<br />
Some glimmering in tomorrow’s light,<br />
Others beaming with joy<br />
From the present now held.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, a decade and some ago,<br />
My children’s childhood song sang<br />
“We’re all in this together”<br />
Yet it’s clear we’re not…<br />
<br />
For if we were: we’d unmake poverty;<br />
Discard war for the fool it is;<br />
And learning would flow<br />
through knowledge and wisdom.<br />
<br />
We’d look to our septic state,<br />
And lance the boils of bigotry,<br />
Cut loose each other’s fetters,<br />
<br />
Now we must tack sail<br />
Through the blustering<br />
   bloviating<br />
      jibbering<br />
         howling<br />
winds of hate.<br />
<br />
Towards the horizon of Justice.<br /></p>
