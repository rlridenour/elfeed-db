 <i>A poem for Memorial Day, 2015, written after conducting a funeral at the Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery, April 23, 2015.</i>
</p>

 <p>
The boy stared, amazed <br></br>
at the ranks and files <br></br>
of perfect straight lines. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Each member stood <br></br>
at attention, a silent and still <br></br>
granite memorial to one <br></br>
who was a child once
</p>

 <p>
before youth was taken, <br></br>
leaving only scars
</p>

 <p>
if anything at all.
</p>
