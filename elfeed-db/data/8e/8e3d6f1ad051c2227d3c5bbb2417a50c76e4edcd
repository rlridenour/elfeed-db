<p><strong>You&rsquo;re using Avy wrong.</strong></p>
<p>Too harsh? Let me rephrase: you&rsquo;re barely using Avy. Still too broad? Okay, the noninflammatory version: Avy, the Emacs package to jump around the screen, lends itself to efficient composable usage that&rsquo;s obscured by default.</p>
<p>Without burying the lede any further, here&rsquo;s a demo that uses a single Avy command (<code>avy-goto-char-timer</code>) to do various things in multiple buffers and windows, all without manually moving the cursor:</p>

<p>Copy text, kill lines or regions, move text around, mark text, bring up help buffers, look up definitions, search google, check my spelling, the list goes on. I emphasize this again: <em>Avy defines dozens of jump commands, but I&rsquo;m only using one.</em> This post breaks this down in detail so you can create your own version of this, but more importantly tries to explain why this is a neat idea.</p>
<p>This is the first of two parts in a series on Avy, an Emacs package for jumping around efficiently with the keyboard. Part 1 is about about supercharging built-in customization to <strong>do anything with Avy</strong>, or some approximation thereof. Part 2 will be a more technical (elisp-y) dive into writing more complex features for your individual needs. If you are interested in the short elisp snippets in this document, they are collated into a single file <a href="https://gist.github.com/karthink/af013ffd77fe09e67360f040b57b4c7b">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="adc2ee"><span class="Filter">Filter</span> → <span class="Select">Select</span> → <span class="Act">Act</span></h2>
<p>We see the same pattern repeated in most interactions with Emacs whose primary purpose isn&rsquo;t typing text. To perform a task, we <span class="Filter">Filter</span>, <span class="Select">Select</span> and <span class="Act">Act</span> in sequence:</p>
<p><strong><span class="Filter">Filter</span></strong>: Winnow a large pile of candidates to a smaller number, usually by typing in some text. These candidates can be anything, see below for examples.</p>
<p><strong><span class="Select">Select</span></strong>: Specify a candidate as the one you need, usually with visual confirmation. If you filter a list down to one candidate, it&rsquo;s automatically selected.</p>
<p><strong><span class="Act">Act</span></strong>: Run the task with this candidate as an argument.</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to open a file? Invoke a command, then type in text to <span class="Filter">filter</span> a list of completions, <span class="Select">select</span> a completion, <span class="Act">find-file</span>.</li>
<li>Switch buffers? Type to <span class="Filter">filter</span>, <span class="Select">select</span> a buffer, <span class="Act">switch</span>.</li>
<li><span class="Act">Autocomplete</span> a symbol in code? Type a few characters to <span class="Filter">narrow</span> a pop-up list, <span class="Select">choose</span> a candidate, confirm.</li>
</ul>
<p>As ever, this model is a simplification. Helm, Ivy, Dired &amp; co let you <span class="Select">select</span> multiple candidates to <span class="Act">act</span> on, for instance. We will put this qualification aside while we explore this idea.</p>
<p>This observation leads to several interesting ideas. For one, the <span class="Filter">Filter</span> → <span class="Select">Select</span> → <span class="Act">Act</span> process is often thought of as a single operation. Decoupling the filtering, selection and action phases (in code and in our heads) frees us to consider a flock of possibilities. Here&rsquo;s minibuffer interaction:</p>
<figure><img src="https://karthinks.com/img/minibuffer-interaction-paradigm.png" width="800px"/>
</figure>

<p>The possibilities are, respectively: different completion styles (matching by regexps, flex, orderless), different selection interfaces (Icomplete, Ivy, Helm, Vertico, Selectrum and more by the day) and different action dispatchers (Embark, Helm/Ivy actions)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. A similar mini-Cambrian explosion has happened in the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/">space of shell utilities</a> since <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> arrived on the scene. In Emacs the minibuffer is where we&rsquo;re used to selecting things, so it&rsquo;s natural to think of these examples.</p>
<p>But this usage pattern extends to more than just minibuffer interaction. We often do things in regular buffers that involve the <span class="Filter">Filter</span> → <span class="Select">Select</span> → <span class="Act">Act</span> pattern. In fact, you can look at most interactions with Emacs (whose focus isn&rsquo;t typing text) this way: when you call a goto-definition command with point&ndash;the text cursor&ndash;in some text, the <span class="Filter">filtering</span> stage is skipped, the <span class="Select">selection</span> is made for you by a function from the <code>thing-at-pt</code> library, and a preset <span class="Act">action</span> is called. How about a mouse interaction? <span class="Filter">scroll</span> through a window full of icons, <span class="Select">move</span> the mouse cursor to an icon and <span class="Act">click</span> on it. These completely redundant examples prime us for the more interesting cases. Consider Isearch:</p>
<figure><img src="https://karthinks.com/img/isearch-interaction-paradigm.png" width="800px"/>
</figure>

<p>When you type (after <code>C-s</code>), you automatically <span class="Filter">filter</span> buffer text and <span class="Select">select</span> the nearest match. You can select each subsequent match in turn, or <span class="Act">jump</span> to the first or last match. The <span class="Act">Act</span> here is the process of moving the cursor to the match location, but it can be one of a few things, like running <code>occur</code> or <code>query-replace</code> on the search string. Many Isearch commands simultaneously filter, select and act, so we&rsquo;re fitting a square peg in a round hole here<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve spent any time using Isearch, you can appreciate the tradeoff involved in dividing a task into these three independently configurable phases. Lumping two or all three into a single operation makes Isearch a <em>wicked fast</em> keyboard interaction. When I use Isearch my brain is usually trying to catch up to my fingers. On the other hand, the advantage of modularity is expressive power. The three phase process is slower on the whole, but we can do a whole lot more by plugging in different pieces into each of the <span class="Filter">Filter</span> , <span class="Select">Select</span> and <span class="Act">Act</span> slots. To see this, you have only to consider how many disparate tasks the minibuffer handles, and in how many different ways!</p>
<p>But back to Isearch: what can we do to decouple the three stages here? Not much without modifying its guts. It&rsquo;s all elisp, so that&rsquo;s not a tall order. For example, Protesilaos Stavrou adds many intuitive actions (such as marking candidates) to Isearch in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6_bmcd3nis">this video</a>. But it turns out we don&rsquo;t need to modify Isearch, because <strong>Avy</strong> exists, has a killer <span class="Filter">Filter</span> feature, and it separates the three stages like a champ. This makes for some very intriguing possibilities.</p>

<h2 id="wait-what-s-avy">Wait, what&rsquo;s Avy?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/avy">Avy</a> is authored by the prolific <a href="https://oremacs.com/">abo-abo</a> (Oleh Krehel), who also wrote Ivy, Counsel, Ace-Window, Hydra, Swiper and many other mainstays of the Emacs package ecosystem that you&rsquo;ve probably used. If you&rsquo;re reading this, chances are you already know (and probably use) Avy. So here&rsquo;s a very short version from the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>avy is a GNU Emacs package for jumping to visible text using a char-based decision tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can call an Avy command and type in some text. Any match for this text on the frame (or all Emacs frames if desired) becomes a selection candidate, with some hint characters overlaid on top. Here I type in &ldquo;an&rdquo; and all strings in the frame that match it are highlighted:</p>
<figure><img src="https://karthinks.com/img/avy-basic-demo.png" width="800px"/>
</figure>

<p>Typing in one of the hints then jumps the cursor to that location. Here I jump to this sentence from another window:</p>

<li>Type in the hint char corresponding to &ldquo;sentence&rdquo;, which is <code>g</code> here.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</details>
<p>Typical Avy usage looks something like this: Jump to a location that matches your text (across all windows), then jump back with <code>pop-global-mark</code> (<code>C-x C-SPC</code>). In a later section <a href="#when-avy-is-too-clever">I go into more detail on jumping back and forth</a> with Avy. Here is a demo of this process where I jump twice with Avy and then jump back in sequence:</p>

<p>Avy handles filtering automatically and the selection is made through a char-based decision tree. Here&rsquo;s how it fits into our three part interaction model.</p>
<h3 id="f868f3"><span class="Filter">Filter</span>,</h3>
<p>Before you call Avy <em>every text character on your screen</em> is a potential candidate for selection. The possibilites are all laid out for you, and there are too many of them!</p>
<p>You filter the candidate pool with Avy similar to how you would in the minibuffer, by typing text. This reduces the size of the pool to those that match your input. Avy provides dozens of filtering styles. It can: only consider candidates above/below point, only beginnings of words, only the current window (or frame), only whitespace, only beginnings of lines, only headings in Org files, the list goes on.</p>

<p>This is a <em>crazy</em> list to keep track of.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>Filtering in Avy is independent of the selection method (as it should be), but there is a dizzying collection of filtering methods. I assume the idea is that the user will pick a couple of commands that they need most often and commit only those to memory.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem: <strong>We want to use our mental bandwidth for the problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve with the text editor, not the editor itself</strong>. Conscious decision-making is expensive and distracting. As of now we need to decide on the fly between Isearch and Avy to find and act on things. If you use a fancy search tool like Swiper, Helm-swoop or Consult-line, you now have three options. Having a bunch of Avy commands on top is a recipe for mental gridlock. To that end, we just pick the most adaptable, flexible and general-purpose Avy command (<code>avy-goto-char-timer</code>) for everything.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (<span style="color:#963">global-set-key</span> (<span style="color:#963">kbd</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0f0">&#34;M-j&#34;</span>) <span style="color:#a60;background-color:#fff0f0">&#39;avy-goto-char-timer</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Further below <a href="./#avy-plus-isearch-seek-then-jump">I make the case</a> that you don&rsquo;t need to make even this decision, you can always use Isearch and switch to Avy as needed.</p>
<p>To be clear, this decision cost has to be balanced against the cost of frequent busywork and chronic context switching that Avy helps avoid. There is a case to be made for adapting Avy&rsquo;s flexible filtering options to our needs, and the <a href="https://melpa.org/#/?q=avy">number of packages</a> that offer Avy-based candidate filtering (for everything from linting errors to buffer selection) attests to this. We will examine this in depth in Part II.</p>
<p>But in this piece we are interested in a different, much less explored aspect of Avy.</p>
<h3 id="3008c7"><span class="Select">Select</span>,</h3>
<p>Every selection method that Avy offers involves typing characters that map to screen locations. This is quite different from Isearch, where you call <code>isearch-repeat-forward</code> (<code>C-s</code>, possibly with a numerical prefix argument) or the minibuffer, where you navigate a completions buffer or list with <code>C-n</code> and <code>C-p</code>. Avy&rsquo;s selection method is generally faster because it minimizes, by design, the length of the character sequences it uses, and we have ten fingers that can access ∼40 keys in O(1) time. The fact that we&rsquo;re often looking directly where we mean to jump means we don&rsquo;t need to parse an entire screen of gibberish. Unfortunately for this article, this means using Avy is much more intuitive than looking at screenshots or watching demos.</p>
<p>This excellent design leaves us with little reason to tinker with the selection phase: it&rsquo;s sufficiently modular and accommodating of different filter and act stages. You can customize <code>avy-style</code> if you want to change the set or positions of characters used for selection. Here is an example of using simple words to select candidates:</p>
<figure><img src="https://karthinks.com/img/avy-words-style-demo.png" width="800px"/>
</figure>

<p>We will pay more attention to the selection operation in part II as well.</p>
<h3 id="fc6ea2"><span class="Act">Act</span>!</h3>
<p>This brings us to the focus of this article. The stated purpose of Avy, jumping to things, makes it sound like a (contextually) faster Isearch. But jumping is only one of many possibilities. Avy provides a &ldquo;dispatch list&rdquo;, a collection of actions you can perform on a candidate, and they are all treated on equal footing with the jump action. You can show these commands any time you use Avy with <code>?</code>:</p>
<figure><img src="https://karthinks.com/img/avy-dispatch-demo.png" width="800px"/>
</figure>

<p>This means we are free to leverage Avy&rsquo;s unique filtering and selection method to <em>whatever action we want to carry out</em> at any location on the screen. Our interaction model now ends in a block that looks something like this:</p>
<figure><img src="https://karthinks.com/img/avy-interaction-paradigm-detailed.png" width="500px"/>
</figure>

<p>Additionally, Avy also defines a few commands that run different actions, like copying text from anywhere on screen:</p>
<p><a id="table--Action commands in Avy"></a></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Kill</th>
<th>Copy</th>
<th>Move</th>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The problem with this approach is that it doesn&rsquo;t scale. Each of these commands defines a full <span class="Filter">Filter</span> → <span class="Select">Select</span> → <span class="Act">Act</span> process, and we quickly run out of headspace and keyboard room if we want any kind of versatility or coverage. They&rsquo;re also not dynamic enough: you&rsquo;re locked into the pipeline and cannot change your mind once you start the command.</p>
<p>Folks love Vim&rsquo;s editing model for a reason: it&rsquo;s a mini-language where knowing M actions (verbs) and N cursor motions gives you M × N composite operations. This (M + N) → (M × N) ratio pays off quadratically with the effort you put into learning verbs and motions in Vim. Easymotion, which is Vim&rsquo;s version of Avy<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, has part of this composability built-in as a result. We seek to bring some of this to Avy, and (because this is Emacs) do a lot more than combining motions with verbs. We won&rsquo;t need to step into Avy&rsquo;s source code for this, it has all the hooks we need already.</p>
<h2 id="avy-actions">Avy actions</h2>
<p>The basic usage for running an arbitrary action with Avy is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call an Avy command. Any command will do, I stick to <code>avy-goto-char-timer</code>.</li>
<li><span class="Filter">Filter</span>: Type in some text to shrink the candidate pool from the entire screen to a few locations.</li>
<li><span class="Act">Act</span>: Specify the action you want to run. You can pull up the dispatch help with <code>?</code>, although you won&rsquo;t have to if you set it up right, see <a href="#remembering-to-avy">Remembering to Avy</a>.</li>
<li><span class="Select">Select</span>: Pick one of the candidates to run the action on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some things I frequently do with Avy. Note that you can do this on any text in your frame, not just the active window!</p>
<p>First, taking the annoyance out of some common editing actions with Avy. If you use Vim and Easymotion, you get the first few actions below for free:</p>
<details open>
<summary>A note about these demos</summary>
<div class="details">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For clarity, I set Avy to desaturate the screen and to &ldquo;pulse&rdquo; the line during a few of these actions. These are not enabled by default. I also slowed down the operations by adding a delay to make them easier to follow. In actual usage these are instantaneous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The keys Avy uses to dispatch actions on candidates are specified in <code>avy-dispatch-alist</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will also need to ensure that these keys don&rsquo;t coincide with the ones Avy uses as selection hints on screen. Consider customizing <code>avy-keys</code> for this.</p>

These are a little faster since they have the <span class="Act">action</span> stage baked into the function call. You might be better served by these. But we want to avoid the mental burden of remembering too many top level commands, so we work in two simpler stages: call <code>avy-goto-char-timer</code> (to <span class="Filter">filter</span> and <span class="Select">select</span>) and then dispatch on our selected candidate as we see fit.</p>

<p>We save ourselves a lot of redundancy and reuse muscle memory here. Avy provides its unique means of filtering and Embark does what it does best, run actions! The intermediate job of candidate selection is shared between Avy and Embark: Avy specifies the general location of the candidate, and Embark figures out the semantic unit at that position on which to act. The fact that the <span class="Filter">Filter</span> → <span class="Select">Select</span> → <span class="Act">Act</span> process is helpfully chunked this way by Avy makes the elisp required to integrate the two completely trivial<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>:</p>

<h2 id="avy-plus-isearch-seek-then-jump">Avy + Isearch: Seek, then jump</h2>
<p>Isearch and Avy have different strengths: Avy jumps quickly to any <em>visible</em> element in any window, Isearch to any matching candidate in this <em>buffer</em>. Avy is faster when you want to cover some distance in a jump, Isearch when you&rsquo;re moving a small distance or a very large one. Avy is useful when your eyes are already on a target, Isearch when you&rsquo;re looking for one. But you don&rsquo;t have you choose. You can handily combine the two by restricting Avy&rsquo;s candidate pool to Isearch candidates: now you can start Isearch and finish with Avy:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Again, consciously deciding which of the two commands to call every time is a bad idea. It&rsquo;s not a bad idea to always Isearch and switch to Avy when necessary:</p>

<li>Start Isearch with <code>C-s</code>. In the video I switched to <code>isearch-regexp</code> with <code>M-r</code>.</li>
<li>Type in a phrase to search for. In the video I typed in a regexp that ends in &ldquo;-region&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Navigate Isearch matches with <code>C-s</code>, recentering the screen with <code>C-l</code> if necessary.</li>
<li>Call <code>avy-goto-char-timer</code>. The candidate pool limits to the Isearch matches.</li>

</details>
<p>At least, that&rsquo;s the usual pitch.</p>
<p>For us, however, &ldquo;jump&rdquo; in that description is replaced with &ldquo;act&rdquo;. We can <em>act</em> on any visible Isearch candidate with one of the above actions. Kill text between two isearch matches? Copy the previous line that contains a word to the current location? Check. Essentially we <span class="Filter">filter</span> with Isearch and <span class="Select">select</span> and <span class="Act">Act</span> with Avy, indirectly decoupling Filter from the other two actions in Isearch.</p>
<h2 id="when-avy-is-too-clever">When Avy is too clever</h2>
<p>This usage pattern has a failure mode. When there&rsquo;s a single match, Avy jumps to the location and does not offer any actions. Oops.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s possible to force Avy to show a selection char/hint for a single match, the default DWIM behavior is usually desirable. There are two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Filter candidates conservatively, for example by typing in a single character. Using <code>avy-goto-char</code> or <code>avy-goto-char-2</code> will almost always result in more than one match, preventing this problem. If you use one of the timer-based Avy commands, you can vary how much text to filter by on the fly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carry out the action the old-fashioned way after jumping, then jump back by popping the mark Avy sets. You can do this with the default <code>set-mark-command</code> (<code>C-u C-SPC</code>)<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. You can do this for most commands that cause the point to jump, including Isearch. Vim users have the jumplist, accessed with <code>C-o</code>, and the changelist, accessed with <code>g;</code>.</p>
<p>In this demo I jump twice with Avy to edit text and then chain jump my way back to where I started:</p>

<h2 id="what-s-the-point-anyway">What&rsquo;s the Point, anyway</h2>
<p>This section is for the pedants.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using &ldquo;point&rdquo; and &ldquo;cursor&rdquo; interchangeably in this article. Yes, I&rsquo;m aware of the distinction.</p>
<p>One of the illustrated advantages of using Avy to filter and select text to run actions on is that you can do it without moving the cursor. But as the above code snippets make clear with their <code>save-excursion</code> blocks, we do move the point, mostly just invisibly. The point is where the &ldquo;gap&rdquo; in Emacs&rsquo; gap-buffer data structure is located, so Emacs commands are all oriented around acting on the point, and usually more efficient when doing so.</p>
<p>Yes: it&rsquo;s much faster to run an Avy action on some text in a different window than it is to call <code>other-window</code>, then Isearch to the text, run an action and switch back. But to me, the Point (har) is primarily a useful abstraction for writing elisp. The real advantage of Avy is in how it lets me think about the contents of the entire frame in the powerful <span class="Filter">Filter</span> → <span class="Select">select</span> → <span class="Act">Act</span> paradigm. The fact that you can do this without the mental context switch involved in expressly navigating around the window or frame is a bonus.</p>
<h2 id="remembering-to-avy">Remembering to Avy</h2>
<p>In some ways, using Avy to jump around the screen is like using a mouse. You could make the case, quite successfully, that the mouse is faster here and thus preferable. This unfavorable comparison evaporates when you add your dispatch actions into the mix. Yanking a line from another window or running goto-definition on a symbol on the other edge of the screen is much faster with Avy than with the mouse selection/right-click business. And this is without taking into account the disruptive effect of frequent context switching, the reason to prefer all keyboard navigation (or all mouse, when possible) in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="the-smell-test">The smell test</h3>
<p>However, using Avy <em>actions</em> is a new way of interacting with text on your screen even if you already use Avy to jump around. To remember to use Avy actions or find new ones, I look for &ldquo;smells&rdquo; in my day-to-day Emacs usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching windows multiple times to land my cursor on some text</li>
<li>Isearching through more than three matches to jump to the right one</li>
<li>Moving the point a long distance to run a lookup command</li>
<li>Activating the mark manually (<code>C-SPC</code>) all the time</li>
<li>Jumping to locations to delete single words</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="buried-in-keymaps">Buried in keymaps</h3>
<p>The other sense of &ldquo;remembering to Avy&rdquo; is that piling a new abstraction onto simple text editing means you have to learn a new keymap. Emacs already has too many of those!</p>
<p>This is true. But the effort is greatly mitigated by a choice of keys that is sensible <em>to you</em>. In the above code snippets, I made choices that mimic my Emacs&rsquo; keybindings (which are close to the default ones) so I don&rsquo;t have to remember anything new:</p>

<p>You can go beyond the mnemonic and simply reuse the same keybindings you use in regular editing, trading off a slightly longer key sequence for maximally reusing your muscle memory. If you&rsquo;re an Embark user, you don&rsquo;t even need the above keys, just one to call <code>embark-act</code>.</p>

<p>In keeping with <code>C-M-v</code> to scroll the other window, you can Isearch the other window with <code>C-M-s</code> without switching to it<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. If you&rsquo;re feeling adventurous, replace <code>(other-window next)</code> in the above functions with <code>(ace-window)</code>.</p>
<p>You can call Avy from Isearch as before, to run actions on essentially any text in the other-window&rsquo;s buffer.</p>

<p>Copying regions of text. This has an Avy-based solution: <code>avy-copy-region</code>. I promised at the beginning, however, that you would only need to call one Avy command. For now you would do this the boring way, using Avy only to make shorter jumps or using Isearch+Avy. The more elispy solution will have to wait until part II of this series.</p>

<p>This post primarily concerned itself with the <span class="Act">Act</span> part as it connects with the ideas in the the previous one about <a href="../fifteen-ways-to-use-embark">ways to use Embark</a>. But Avy is composed of modular pieces that makes it suitable for a wide variety of <span class="Filter">Filter</span> → <span class="Select">Select</span> applications as well. In part II of this series, we will dig into the Avy API and see how to create unique commands.</p>

<p>Technically there&rsquo;s also sorting the candidates, which I lump in with filtering in this breakdown.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Isearch combines filter/search/act into a single command for efficiency. Even so, it&rsquo;s a very cleverly designed library for Emacs with support for many actions. Folks who replace Isearch entirely with Swiper or similar commands are missing out.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Or perhaps Avy is Emacs&rsquo; version of Easymotion.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Why would you want to google an s-expression? The most common reason is when the sexp is a hyphenated phrase, like Fink-Nottle.&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Technically this is false, since we use <code>save-excursion</code> in all the avy action functions. The real accomplishment here is that I got almost 4000 words into this piece before mentioning Embark.&#160;<a href="#fnref:6" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>If you end up in a different window you can pop the global mark instead with <code>pop-global-mark</code> (<code>C-x C-SPC</code>). There are also external packages for this now, like <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/dogears.el">dogears</a>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:7" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p><code>C-M-s</code> is bound to <code>isearch-forward-regexp</code> by default. You can continue to access it with <code>M-r</code> in the Isearch map, <em>i.e.</em> <code>C-s M-r</code>.&#160;<a href="#fnref:8" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
