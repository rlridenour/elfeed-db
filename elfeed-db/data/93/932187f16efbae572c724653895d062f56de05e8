<p>
This month, A+ asked me if we could do a field
trip. Since her virtual grade 3 class was doing a
unit on drawing landscapes, I thought I'd take her
to the <a href="https://ago.ca/">Art Gallery of Ontario</a> so that she could
<a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/02/looking-at-landscapes-art-and-iteration/">practise digital painting</a> surrounded by lots of
great examples. I enjoyed that enough to get <a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/02/two-weeks-with-the-ipad-air-supernote-a5x-and-lenovo-p52/">my
own iPad</a> for drawing on. She asked for another
field trip the following week to check out the
<a href="https://sachachua.com/blog/2025/02/ago-field-trip-2-moments-in-modernism-landscapes/">Moments in Modernism exhibit</a>, so we got to
practise digital painting together. (We ended up
back in the landscape gallery.) I wonder what
we'll explore next month.
</p>

<p>
Being able to do iPad things together also nudged
us to explore music and art. I experimented with
paying for the <a href="https://www.hellosimply.com/">Simply</a> family subscription. A+ and
I have been practising singing and piano, and W-
has been practising patience. I've been <a href="https://sketches.sachachua.com/">going
through the art tutorials too</a>. A+ has run out of
colourful drawings to work on and is not
particularly interested in the pencil courses, so
maybe that'll be for later.
</p>

<p>
It was A+'s birthday this month. She wanted to
have a skating party with just her closest friends
and their families. We made and decorated cupcakes
and cookies, and then we brought her and the party
supplies over to the park in our cargo bikes. W-
brought over pizza and hot chocolate. I enjoyed
drawing a one-page summary of A+'s 8th year, and
that also helped other people get a sense of what
we've been up to the rest of the year. I used
parts of that drawing for little thank-you cards
for her friends, too.
</p>

<p>
Lots and lots of snow this month. It's amazing how
much some guerilla shovelling can make a
difference. We cleared the entrance to the Martin
Goodman Trail closest to our house, and W- also
cleared some things in our neighbourhood and on
our bike ride home.

<h2 id="org82f8901">Checking in with myself</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org82f8901">
<p>
I noticed I've been a little more fretful than I'd
like to be. I think I've been letting myself get
all tangled up in worries about A+ and school fit,
and I've also been staying up late exploring
sketching. My current plan is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>schedule fretting for Saturdays so that I don't
fret too much at A+ during the week</li>
<li>remind myself of counterexamples: A+ does
actually get her work done, and she's pretty
good at making decisions; even if she messes up,
failure is feedback</li>
<li>externalize my anxiety by calling her "Gumamelon" (long story),
and thank her for showing up and trying to
protect us and make life easier</li>
<li>try to get better at detecting when Gumamelon is
sneaking up on me, write down her concerns, and
remind her that she can come back on Saturday.</li>
<li>distract Gumamelon with other things I can do</li>
<li>sleep better</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's weird, but maybe it'll help. =)
</p>

<p>
Also, trying out this approach of answering
reflection questions in order to think more
deeply.

<h2 id="orgbd19663">Where did I feel most energized this month? What activities drained me?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbd19663">
<p>
I liked figuring things out with W- and A+,
whether it was breaking up the ice on the walkway
or redoing the galaxy icing on the cupcakes. I
also liked the calmness of going through the music
and art tutorials, even if they felt quite slow at
times. I'm not too keen on the frazzled feeling of
fretting at A+, but I'm glad I'm getting better at
recognizing the irrationality of it, and that both
W- and A+ are good at reminding me to back off.
I'm looking forward to finding ways to redirect
that. This might be the time to get back into
exploring the things I want to learn. That'll keep
me plenty busy.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4065411" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4065411">What moments made me say "aha!" this month?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4065411">
<p>
It's interesting to see how both A+ and I respond
well to impersonal feedback from a computer and to
breaking things down into bite-sized, gamified
learning. The pitch visualizations in the singing
app have been helping her pay more attention to
melody. I like the way the notes in the piano app
don't let me move forward until I get them right.
I'm going to experiment with pitch detection to
practise singing scales. I want to see if I can
get Claude AI to give me reasonably-useful writing
feedback, too.

Nudged by Gina Trapani's <a href="https://weeks.ginatrapani.org/">My Life in Weeks</a> (found
via <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43061498">HN</a>) and the <a href="https://lifeweeks.app/">Life in Weeks</a> app (also discussed
on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43183635">HN</a>), I'm noodling around the idea of having a
quick but expressive overview. I have a journal
covering most of the days since 2016, somewhat
spotty coverage of weekly/monthly notes before
then, and yearly reviews going back to 2005. If I
wanted to summarize each day with an emoji,
February would be:

Which is promisingly compact and could be fun to
experiment with over the year, and then maybe I
could pick weekly highlights too.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, in March, I'd like to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Practise being calmer and more easygoing; get better at thinking in terms of experiments</li>
<li>Take A+ on more informal field trips: Royal Ontario Museum, pottery class</li>
<li>Start digging into the ideas and tasks I've been postponing</li>
<li>Finish the Simply Piano course and start working on sheet music for the songs A+ wants to sing</li>
<li>Practise singing scales while waiting for A+ to catch up with Simply Sing</li>
<li>Automate the BigBlueButton setup a bit more so that I don't forget about meetups</li>
