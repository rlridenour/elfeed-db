Yesterday&rsquo;s Red Meat Friday post on <a href="https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12831">Why Lisp &ldquo;Lost&rdquo;</a> has a backstory. As I often do, I wrote it the night before and had it queued up for publication on Friday. But I also like to read through the posts one last time before I upload them to Irreal.

When I did that, I realized that I hadn&rsquo;t provided a link to Alexander_Selkirk&rsquo;s original post that anchored the whole discussion. I usually keep whatever site I&rsquo;m writing about in a browser tab so it should have been easy to add that link. But something was wonky with that tab so I thought I&rsquo;d just restart Safari and get things straightened out. But, unlike all my other tabs, that one didn&rsquo;t come back when I restarted Safari.

<p>
No problem. My post has a link to the offending comment; I&rsquo;ll use it to reload Alexander_Selkirk&rsquo;s post. Except when I tried that I got a totally unrelated post in German. Argh! Next I spent an hour trying to find the post in the Lisp subreddit. That, of course, ended in tears.

<p>
Then I remembered that I had first discovered Alexander_Selkirk&rsquo;s post in my feed. Since my feed reader is <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">Elfeed</a>, I realized that I could recover by simply asking Elfeed to find the post for me. Unlike many feed readers, Elfeed keeps a complete history of everything it shows you and has a powerful search capability so it was surprisingly easy to find the post. I simply looked for any posts discussing Common Lisp in the last six months. I was about to add the additional constraint of mentioning Steve Losh when I noticed that Elfeed was already showing me the desired post.

It&rsquo;s like having a associative array into every post that&rsquo;s ever appeared in your feed. If you&rsquo;re using Emacs and not using Elfeed, you should think about switching. I&rsquo;ve said before that Elfeed is one of those packages that alone make it worthwhile to use Emacs.</p>
