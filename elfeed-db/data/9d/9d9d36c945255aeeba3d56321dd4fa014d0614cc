<li>Some 6-foot cords with USB-A ports on the end</li>
<li>Not the most powerful things</li>
<li>Still very functional</li>
<li>Are they available in Georgia Red: No, they’re much cooler looking than that</li>

<p>hmmm, im not sure how many 2010 USB devices i still have laying around. I’ll pass.</p>

<p>And, honestly, this is a solid point.</p>
<p>We’re looking at a pair of cords with 4 USB-A ports along the end of each of them. In other words, these are not the most powerful, fast-charging pieces of equipment out there. So, they’re maybe not ideal for your most prized devices.</p>
<p>Like your phone, for example.</p>
<p>Could they charge an iPhone? Probably. But you want something that delivers a payload of juice to that thing FAST, right? You want something where, when you look and see it’s in the red fifteen minutes before you’re gonna leave the house, you can plug it in while you get ready and step out the door comfortably enough in the green.</p>
<p>Yet we need to push back just slightly on audiocontr’s statement. Because I don’t know about you, but I still have plenty of stuff that’ll charge just fine on one of these things.</p>
<p>Like, before going to bed, I could plug in my running headlamp into one port and my Garmin watch into another and my earbuds into a third, and they’d be perfectly ready to go for an early morning jog.</p>
<p>And to be clear, you all echoed this sentiment in the comments.</p>

<p>I just got a bunch of LED lights for illuminating decorative crystals, and they all plug in via USB-A, so this works perfectly for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to use them to charge my ear buds and cameras.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even naysayer <a href="/@caffeineguy">@caffeineguy</a> came up with two good uses for them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only use for these I can think of is stuff like the kid’s Echo Glow and/or their dinosaur lights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/@PooltoyWolf">@PooltoyWolf</a>, meanwhile, expressed remorse at missing out on them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could actually really use one of these for the precarious placement of my new Alarmo alarm clock, if y’all plan to sell more at some point!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <a href="/@PooltoyWolf">@PooltoyWolf</a>, here’s your heads-up!</p>
<p>Point is: they’re not very exciting. But they do serve some purpose. So, if you have a use for them, maybe grab a couple. They’re pretty cheap.</p>
