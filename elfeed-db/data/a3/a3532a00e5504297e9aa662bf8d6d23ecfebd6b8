Speaking of interesting, free resources,  <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">DuoLingo</a> is a site reminiscent of Rosetta Stone. I’ve started the German course for review, and it seems to be very well done so far. I notice that they have Danish — maybe it’s time to get serious about studying Kierkegaard.
