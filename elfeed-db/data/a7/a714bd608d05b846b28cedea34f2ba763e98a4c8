Charles Choi is back with another app in his causal suite. This time it&rsquo;s about making it easier to work with the Make utility. For reasons that I don&rsquo;t understand, lots of people hate make and complain, in particular, about the significance of <code>tabs</code> in a make script. I love Make and have used it happily for years.

To be sure, it can be a bit fiddly to set up a script—especially in Make&rsquo;s modern incarnations—but once that&rsquo;s done, building the program (or whatever) is easy. You simply type make and go out for a coffee. My impression is that make is not used—at least directly—as much anymore. That&rsquo;s probably because IDEs do a lot of the things that we used to depend on Make for.

Regardless, Choi&rsquo;s latest offering helps with the hard part: writing and understanding Make scripts. I haven&rsquo;t installed it yet and it&rsquo;s a bit hard to figure out how it works from Choi&rsquo;s announcement but it seems like a really useful addition to our toolkits. One of the worst things about Make scripts are the macros. As Choi says, it&rsquo;s impossible to remember what they do so <i>Casual Make</i> has a special facility for discovering their meaning. You can get an idea of some of the other functions by looking at the menu in Choi&rsquo;s announcement.

Like everyone else, I seem to use Make less often these days so I&rsquo;m glad to have this app to help me remember the details. It&rsquo;s much easier than reading through the manual.</p>
