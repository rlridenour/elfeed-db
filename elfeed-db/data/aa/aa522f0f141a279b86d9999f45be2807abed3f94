</p>

 <p>
God of grace and hope,
</p>

 <p>
We confess that, sometimes, <br></br>
we are like Israel in Egypt, <br></br>
overwhelmed by life and <br></br>
tempted to believe that <br></br>
you have abandoned your people.
</p>

 <p>
In this, though, we have hope, <br></br>
though Israel had forgotten you, <br></br>
you did not abandon her. <br></br>
Instead, you called Moses <br></br>
to be her minister.
</p>

 <p>
And so, from the desert <br></br>
of our dry and parched lives, <br></br>
you continue to call — <br></br>
not from a burning bush, <br></br>
but from within, <br></br>
from a heart aflame <br></br>
with passion for <br></br>
the kingdom of God <br></br>
and for your people.
</p>

 <p>
Today, we give thanks for Kim, <br></br>
a minister with such a heart, <br></br>
who, like Moses, <br></br>
has answered your call.
</p>

 <p>
Grant her the vision <br></br>
to see things as they are, <br></br>
and the spiritual imagination <br></br>
to recognize what they could be.
</p>

 <p>
May her laughter be joyful; <br></br>
her anger, righteous; <br></br>
her compassion, gentle; <br></br>
her witness, bold; <br></br>
and her love, deep.
</p>

 <p>
Fill her with the <br></br>
power of the Almighty, <br></br>
who took what was <br></br>
formless and void <br></br>
and created the universe, <br></br>
then declared it good.
</p>

 <p>
May her ministry <br></br>
be the means by which <br></br>
you continue to take <br></br>
what is broken and empty, <br></br>
and create that which is <br></br>
new, beautiful and good.
</p>

 <p>
In the name of the Father <br></br>
who gives us our mission, <br></br>
and of the Son, <br></br>
whose obedience is our model, <br></br>
and of the Spirit, <br></br>
who gives us strength <br></br>
for our task.
</p>

 <p>
Three persons, <br></br>
one God, <br></br>
forever and ever.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
