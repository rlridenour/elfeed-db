“Where are you?”
</p>

 <p>
The sound of heartbreak <br></br>
rang through the garden <br></br>
as the Lord went out <br></br>
in the cool of the evening <br></br>
to meet his children, <br></br>
who hid in the place <br></br>
that he gave them, <br></br>
a place made for <br></br>
fellowship with God.
</p>

 <p>
God still calls, <br></br>
and we still hide, <br></br>
in places built for <br></br>
communion with him, <br></br>
masking our shame and fear <br></br>
by doing the good while <br></br>
failing to hear his call <br></br>
to something great.
</p>

 <p>
Father, forgive us.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
