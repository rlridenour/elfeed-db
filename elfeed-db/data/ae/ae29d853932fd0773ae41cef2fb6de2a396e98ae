Sheri and I recently spent the weekend with some soldiers from my Afghanistan deployment and their families. I wrote this prayer after reflecting on the experience:
</p>


 <p>
God of promise and hope, <br></br></p>

 <p>
We give thanks today for shared memories. <br></br></p>

 <p>
The stories bring healing <br></br>
as they are told and retold, <br></br>
for they remind us <br></br>
that joy is found in surprising places. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Cherish our remembering, <br></br>
and strengthen our minds <br></br>
as the years pass, <br></br>
for you are God, our God, <br></br>
who forgets no one. <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
