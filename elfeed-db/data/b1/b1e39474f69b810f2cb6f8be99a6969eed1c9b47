We missed worship at NorthHaven this past Sunday, although I hear that there was an exceptional sermon by Bryan Partridge. Instead, I was at the 2014 meeting of the Baptist Association of Philosophy Teachers. A common theme of the presentations that I heard was the virtue of humility, one that seems often missing from academic life. This week’s prayer:
</p>


 <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Protect me from the temptation <br></br>
to mistake sarcasm for honesty, <br></br>
cynicism for realism, <br></br>
and cleverness for wisdom.
</p>

 <p>
Cleanse my heart from anything <br></br>
that keeps me from loving <br></br>
and learning from everyone <br></br>
that you place in my path, <br></br>
especially those that make me uncomfortable.
</p>

 <p>
Teach me to rejoice in the differences, <br></br>
for what can I learn <br></br>
from those that already <br></br>
think as I do, <br></br>
believe as I do, <br></br>
and speak as I do?
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
