I’m back at the Chaplains’ School for the first time in seven years. One of my classmates for this course asked me today if I was a runner. He said that I looked like someone who passed him on a 5-K in Baghdad. We were stationed on the same base at the same time, so I guess it was me. In honor of those memories, I posted a photo of the 378th Baghdad Army Ten-Miler group. This was before the race, I’m not looking so good in the after-race picture.
