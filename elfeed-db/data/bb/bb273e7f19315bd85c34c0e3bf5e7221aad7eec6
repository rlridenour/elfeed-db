A reflection on the lives lost this week in Charleston, and the responsibility that we bear, either explicitly or implicitly:
</p>

 <p>
God of justice,
</p>

 <p>
We are told that heaven rejoices <br></br>
over what has been found, <br></br>
does heaven also weep for <br></br>
what has been lost? <br></br> <br></br>
For the one whose heart <br></br>
was lost in hatred, <br></br>
and whose mind was <br></br>
filled with empty lies? <br></br> <br></br>
For the nine lives that <br></br>
were taken in an act <br></br>
of unspeakable horror? <br></br> <br></br>
Does heaven also mourn <br></br>
at the loss of our hope, <br></br>
or does heaven simply sigh, <br></br>
for that hope was <br></br>
always vain and self-serving? <br></br> <br></br>
For we hoped that <br></br>
things would get better <br></br>
as time passed, <br></br>
with no effort, and no cost, <br></br> <br></br>
We hoped to measure our lives <br></br>
by the things that we have, <br></br>
and not by the people that we ignore, <br></br> <br></br>
We hoped that it would <br></br>
be enough to just not hate, <br></br>
even if we could not really love. <br></br> <br></br>
Forgive us, Lord, <br></br>
for the sin of settling for <br></br>
something less than than <br></br>
the full Kingdom of God, <br></br> <br></br>
But even more for the <br></br>
greater sin of never <br></br>
really wanting it at all.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
