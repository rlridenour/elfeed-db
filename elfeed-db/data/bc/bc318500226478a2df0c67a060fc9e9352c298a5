This is a prayer I wrote for the Christmas special at NorthHaven Church today:
</p>

 <p>
Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Once again, <br></br>
the angels invite us <br></br>
to come, <br></br>
behold, <br></br>
and adore.
</p>

 <p>
Now may your spirit of peace <br></br>
quiet our minds, <br></br>
prepare our hearts, <br></br>
and open our eyes <br></br>
this Christmas season <br></br>
that we may see <br></br>
the beauty of the Savior <br></br>
as if for the very first time.
</p>

 <p>
And then, as we run to Bethlehem in joy <br></br>
to worship the newborn King, <br></br>
may we do so <br></br>
knowing that the tiny arms <br></br>
that reached out to Mary <br></br>
are the same arms that were stretched out <br></br>
to redeem the world;
</p>

 <p>
And the song that the angels sang <br></br>
is but a shadow of the one <br></br>
that all creation will sing <br></br>
in the world to come:
</p>

 <p>
Gloria in excelsis Deo,
</p>

 <p>
Glory, <br></br>
Glory, <br></br>
Glory to God in the highest!
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
