Because I&rsquo;m the way I am, I keep fairly detailed records of my day. My system is loosely based on the NYPD memo books in which officers record every event they respond to as well as other useful data. I record my information in the Apple Notes app because it syncs across all my devices so I can record events on, say, my iPhone and it will appear on my laptop as well so that I can import it into Emacs.

One of the problems is that I have to explicitly record the time for each event. That&rsquo;s a bit of a pain so I&rsquo;m always on the lookout for a better way. What I&rsquo;d like is an app that prepends a time stamp to each entry automatically and that allows me to make an entry orally like the Notes app does.

I&rsquo;m still looking but I just came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1j393t5/journelly_kinda_like_tweeting_but_for_your_eyes/">Journelly</a> from Álvaro Ramírez. He doesn&rsquo;t have a releasable app yet but the prototype looks promising. It&rsquo;s probably more than I need but seems to check all the boxes for me with the possible exception of entering items orally. I will definitely be trying this when he releases it.</p>
