Grieving for the lives lost in Oregon, a <br></br>
prayer for World Communion Sunday, 2015:
</p>

 <p>
Merciful God,
</p>

 <p>
At least three while <br></br>
we sit in worship,
</p>

 <p>
Eighty today, <br></br>
as we rest <br></br>
on the Sabbath,
</p>

 <p>
Thirty thousand lives <br></br>
lost in a single year.
</p>

 <p>
Some were taken <br></br>
by their own hand, <br></br>
some by accident, <br></br>
still others by strangers.
</p>

 <p>
All were lost in <br></br>
brutal acts of violence, <br></br>
sacrificed on the altar <br></br>
of our rights.
</p>

 <p>
Christ gave up everything <br></br>
so that I might have life, <br></br>
what am I willing to give up
so that others may live?
</p>

 <p>
Lord, have mercy.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
