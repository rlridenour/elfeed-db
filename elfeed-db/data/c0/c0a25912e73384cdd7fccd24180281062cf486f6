What is it like <br></br>
to burn, <br></br>
but never burn up; <br></br>
to endure the pain <br></br>
of the flame, <br></br>
but never know <br></br>
the relief of destruction? <br></br> <br></br>
With no hope for the future, <br></br>
and no memory of their past, <br></br>
your people endured <br></br>
the burden of slavery; <br></br>
people who burn, <br></br>
but never burn up. <br></br> <br></br>
Then Moses heard a voice, <br></br>
saying, <br></br> <br></br>
“I see their misery; <br></br>
I hear their cries; <br></br>
indeed, I know their sufferings. <br></br>
Take off your shoes, <br></br>
for you stand on holy ground.” <br></br> <br></br>
Father, we confess <br></br>
that we are not like you. <br></br>
We see the suffering, <br></br>
we hear the cries, <br></br>
yet we do not feel the pain. <br></br> <br></br>
Open our eyes this week <br></br>
to the suffering <br></br>
of your world, <br></br>
and open our ears to the <br></br>
voice that cries from the cross, <br></br> <br></br>
May we remove our shoes, <br></br>
for we stand with those who suffer, <br></br>
in the shadow of the God who suffers with them. <br></br> <br></br></p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
