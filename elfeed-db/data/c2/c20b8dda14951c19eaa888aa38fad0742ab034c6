Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Examine our hearts, <br></br>
and test our wills <br></br>
against your own. <br></br></p>

 <p>
We pray for the coming of your Kingdom <br></br>
here, on earth, <br></br>
even as it is in heaven. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Yet we confess that sometimes, <br></br>
these are just sounds made with our voices, <br></br>
not reflections of the desires of our hearts. <br></br>
For in that day, <br></br>
the high shall be brought down <br></br>
and the low shall be lifted up <br></br>
and compared to most, <br></br>
we live in power, prestige, and comfort.
</p>

 <p>
At other times, the words are sincere, <br></br>
a promise that we fear can never be fulfilled, <br></br>
for the death, sickness, pain, and loss often <br></br>
seem more real to us than the words that we pray. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Yet you know this, Lord, <br></br>
You know our deepest secrets, frailties, and deceits, <br></br>
and ask us to pray anyway, <br></br>
for our prayers may <br></br>
turn to hopes, <br></br>
our hopes, to dreams, <br></br>
and our dreams, <br></br>
to a new vision of what can truly be.
</p>

 <p>
May it begin, here, in this place, <br></br>
with us, your people, <br></br>
by the power of the Spirit, <br></br>
the abundant grace of the Father, <br></br>
and the sacrificial love of the Son.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
