God of life,
</p>

 <p>
Sometimes our prayers are as parched as the desert <br></br>
and our hearts as dry as the dunes of sand.
</p>

 <p>
We take offense at things that don’t matter, <br></br>
but ignore the ones that do.
</p>

 <p>
When others are hungry, <br></br>
we are full.
</p>

 <p>
When others are hurting, <br></br>
we are numb.
</p>

 <p>
When others are cold, <br></br>
we rest comfortably <br></br>
beneath warm blankets of apathy.
</p>

 <p>
But even in our self-righteousness, <br></br>
we still feel something, <br></br>
a deep ache of longing, <br></br>
a thirst for something <br></br>
greater than ourselves, <br></br>
a lingering thought <br></br>
that you are still there. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Emmanuel, <br></br>
God with us. <br></br></p>

 <p>
Despite our weakness, <br></br>
you have called us to be your people, <br></br>
ambassadors of your kingdom.
</p>

 <p>
Lead us once more to the well of your grace, <br></br>
Bathe us again in the streams of your mercy.
</p>

 <p>
Open the floodgates of your love, <br></br>
and let the rivers flow.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
