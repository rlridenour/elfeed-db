God of compassion, In this week of violence and tragedy, <br></br>
we mourn with those who grieve, <br></br>
cry with those who weep, <br></br>
and sit in silence with those in pain. 
</p>

 <p>
But what should never happen even once <br></br>
seems to happen over and over again, <br></br>
until we are left with nothing <br></br>
but bloodshot eyes and numb hearts. 
</p>

 <p>
Even so, Lord, this is our witness: 
</p>

 <p>
You are with us, <br></br>
and in your presence, <br></br>
We will not be afraid. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear the world, <br></br>
for it is your creation. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear the future, <br></br>
for you have already redeemed it. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear the unknown, <br></br>
for surely you have seen it. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear the stranger, <br></br>
for that person was made in your image, <br></br>
even as we are made. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear our weakness, <br></br>
for you will give us strength. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not fear the darkness, <br></br>
For we carry the light with us. 
</p>

 <p>
You are there, <br></br>
and we are not alone. 
</p>

 <p>
We will not be afraid. 
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
