Holy God,
</p>

 <p>
Forgive us for those times <br></br></p>

 <p>
When individuality was more <br></br>
important to us than community…
</p>

 <p>
When being right was more <br></br>
important to us than being loving…
</p>

 <p>
When our own agendas were more <br></br>
important to us than your Kingdom…
</p>

 <p>
When our own labels were more <br></br>
important to us than the name of Christ.
</p>

 <p>
Give us now a new vision <br></br>
of that which binds us together,
</p>

 <p>
The same baptism, <br></br>
in response to the same call, <br></br>
to fulfill the same mission, <br></br>
in service to the same Lord.
</p>

 <p>
For then, we sill see in others, <br></br>
not differences to be feared, <br></br>
but diversity to be embraced,
</p>

 <p>
Modeling before the world, <br></br>
the beauty of the Triune God, <br></br></p>

 <p>
Father, Son, and Spirit, <br></br></p>

 <p>
Three persons, <br></br>
but one God, <br></br></p>

 <p>
Forever and ever,
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
