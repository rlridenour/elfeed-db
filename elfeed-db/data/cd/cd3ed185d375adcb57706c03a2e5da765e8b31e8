Almost every Emacs user knows that you can use <kbd>Esc</kbd> as the <kbd>Meta</kbd> key. It started because keyboards between, say, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard">Space Cadet keyboard</a> and modern keyboards didn&rsquo;t have an <kbd>Alt</kbd> key to act as <kbd>Meta</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
The practice lives on. Guys like <a href="https://cestlaz.zamansky.net/">Mike Zamansky</a> started with keyboards lacking an <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and continue using <kbd>Esc</kbd> out of muscle memory. I somehow missed all that and I&rsquo;ve always considered it a bit odd but dismissed it as ingrained muscle memory as in Zamansky&rsquo;s case.

Bozhidar Batsov has a <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2025/03/03/the-role-of-the-escape-key-in-emacs/">different take</a>. He started using the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key for <kbd>Meta</kbd> but has found that he likes using <kbd>Esc</kbd> more.
</p>
<p>
Batsov makes a cogent argument for preferring <kbd>Esc</kbd> and I found myself almost convinced but I know that at this stage it would be <i>really</i> difficult to retrain my muscle memory. It&rsquo;s not just <kbd>Alt</kbd> → <kbd>Esc</kbd>. Rather it&rsquo;s all those <kbd>Meta</kbd> + <code>...</code> bindings that I think of a unit. I don&rsquo;t think of them as <kbd>Alt</kbd> and then some other key(s) but as a single binding so switching to use <kbd>Esc</kbd> would mean relearning many, many bindings.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, you don&rsquo;t really have to choose. It&rsquo;s not a configuration item: both <kbd>Alt</kbd> and <kbd>Esc</kbd> work out of the box so you can use either or both. Of course, that adds even more complexity.
</p>
<p>
In short, I find Batsov&rsquo;s arguments compelling but not enough to go through the pain of retraining years of muscle memory. But I <i>do</i> have a new appreciation for those who use <kbd>Esc</kbd>.</p>
