God of compassion,
</p>

 <p>
Peter and John met a man <br></br>
asking for alms <br></br>
at the Beautiful Gate <br></br>
of the temple.
</p>

 <p>
We are not like Peter and John, <br></br>
when they met the man <br></br>
at the Beautiful Gate, <br></br>
for we do have <br></br>
silver and gold <br></br>
to give.
</p>

 <p>
But before we give, <br></br>
we pray that you <br></br>
would examine our hearts.
</p>

 <p>
Do we give to maintain <br></br>
the myth of our own superiority?
</p>

 <p>
Do we give as a a means of exercising power?
</p>

 <p>
Or do we give in a way that recognizes the <br></br>
other person as one who bears <br></br>
the image of Christ himself?
</p>

 <p>
“Look at us,” Peter said.
</p>

 <p>
Look at us, Lord. <br></br>
Look with us. <br></br>
Look through us.
</p>

 <p>
Help us to see the ones <br></br>
sitting outside our own <br></br>
Beautiful Gates.
</p>

 <p>
Amen
</p>
