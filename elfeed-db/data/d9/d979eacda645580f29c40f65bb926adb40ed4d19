<p>Emacs is reasonably consistent across its major-modes in its common usage patterns and keybindings. For example, <code>C-M-a</code> and <code>C-M-e</code> consistently move you to the beginnings and ends of functions in various language modes, and <code>C-c C-z</code> moves the focus to REPLs and back. In read-only modes <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> move the cursor up and down, and <code>w</code> generally copies the path, address or URL of the buffer to the kill ring.</p>
<p>One of these consistent (but less well known) keybindings is for going back and forward across nodes in a tree, arranged into a list: <code>l</code> and <code>r</code> traverse your history and &ldquo;forward&rdquo; history of visited help pages in <code>help-mode</code>, info nodes in <code>Info-mode</code>
<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">
Info mode takes this further. <code>L</code> gives you an index of your visited nodes, which is itself placed into history!
</small></span>
, web pages in <code>eww</code>, locations in <code>pdf-tools</code> and probably others. I think of this as moving [l]eft or [r]ight across a traversal path.</p>
<p>But there are some omissions. I frequently find myself using <code>l</code> and <code>r</code> in dired buffers to navigate my history of visited dired buffers, where it annoyingly does nothing. I assumed this feature would be part of one of the many, many Emacs packages that extend dired, but while there are big total makeovers (like <a href="https://github.com/ralesi/ranger.el">ranger.el</a>) for dired that include it, there wasn&rsquo;t anything simple.</p>
<p>So I wrote a helper: <a href="https://github.com/karthink/dired-hist">dired-hist</a>. It&rsquo;s very basic (&lt; 50 LOC) and will remain so, although I might add some customization options in time.</p>
