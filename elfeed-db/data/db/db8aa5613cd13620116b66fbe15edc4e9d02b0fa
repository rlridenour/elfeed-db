Father, We pray for those who labor, For those who are blessed <br></br>
to do what they love, For those who do what they must <br></br>
in order to simply survive. For those with hands as rough <br></br>
as the son of a carpenter, For those with backs as bent <br></br>
as the one who bore a cross <br></br>
through the streets of Jerusalem, And for those who have been <br></br>
shamed, despised and humiliated, <br></br>
while serving at earthly tables, <br></br>
patiently and humbly waiting <br></br>
for a seat at the heavenly banquet. 
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
