God of compassion,
</p>

 <p>
There are times when it <br></br>
seems impossible to give thanks, <br></br>
for the loss is too recent <br></br>
and the pain is too great.
</p>

 <p>
But in this, we have hope, <br></br>
That even in the darkest valley, <br></br>
we are not alone, for you are there
</p>

 <p>
And our hope is not in vain, <br></br>
for we see your presence in <br></br>
the church, the body of Christ, <br></br>
which walks beside us.
</p>

 <p>
Give us the grace and love <br></br>
to maintain this community, <br></br>
so that our hope may be proclaimed, <br></br>
again, and again, and again, <br></br>
until that day when Christ himself <br></br>
will wipe every tear from every eye.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
