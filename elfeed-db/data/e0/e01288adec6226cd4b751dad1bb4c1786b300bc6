I have been browsing  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> themes lately,
and found a very nice theme for academics, the  <a href="http://elotroalex.github.io/ed/documentation/#bibliographies">Ed. Theme</a>. Its main purpose seems to be publishing classic texts and poetry on the web, and it includes some very handy tools.
</p>

 <p>
Getting indentation right is a problem with poetry on the web. For example, consider these lines from “The Code—Heroics” by Robert Frost.
</p>

 <p>
Here is the Markdown source:
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="orge72eba0">
What was there wrong?
		     Something you said just now.
What did I say?
	       About our taking pains.


Even though it contains the proper indentation, it renders like this:

What was there wrong?
		     Something you said just now.
What did I say?
	       About our taking pains.
</pre>

 <p>
Now, stripping out extra whitespace is generally a good thing, but I don’t want it to happen with poetry. With help from the CSS in the .Ed theme, I can get the indentation right.
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="orgea04278">
- What was there wrong?
- {:.indent-10}Something you said just now.
- What did I say?
- {:.indent-6}About our taking pains.
{:.poetry}
</pre>


 <p>
Ed. sets poetry as an unordered list, with each line as a list item. List style is set to “none” and the indented lines contain an “indent-x” attribute. This produces these properly indented lines:
</p>

 <pre class="example" id="org18a3de1">
- What was there wrong?
- {:.indent-10}Something you said just now.
- What did I say?
- {:.indent-65}About our taking pains.
{:.poetry}
</pre>

 <p>
Ed. also contains formatting tools for bibliographies. It’s built on  <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">Lanyon</a>, the theme that I use, so it was easy for me to just add the CSS that I wanted to my existing site.
