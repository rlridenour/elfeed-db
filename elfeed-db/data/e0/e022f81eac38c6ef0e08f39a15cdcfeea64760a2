<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Writing about the bird feeders near where I spend my working hours. Then a poem.
</p>
<p>For <time datetime="2025-01-20" title="2025-01-20">the</time> <time datetime="2025-01-21" title="2025-01-21">last</time> <time datetime="2025-01-22" title="2025-01-22">few</time> <time datetime="2025-01-23" title="2025-01-23">days</time>, the temperature in my spot amidst the Great Lakes, has
been very cold. Between the hour after sunrise and hour before sunset, a
variety of birds congregate around a well provisioned feeder.</p>
<p>My mother in-law keeps it well stocked. To meet their caloric needs during
these deep cold spells requires almost daily restocks.</p>
<p>I spend most of my working hours near the window that looks upon the four
feeders: 3 for seeds and one further away with suet. I could watch them all
day: diving from the neighboring young maple to the feeder or the ground;
scattering when startled either from my standing or some other registered
threat.</p>
<p>With the wind and snow blowing, they look all fat, but that is them puffing out,
using their feathers to ablate and confound the piercing cold.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, they might break and flee towards a wooded grove. They
perch a stone’s throw away on a mature redbud. That redbud is nearer a never
freezing pond; one created by the circulating waters of the house’s heat pump.</p>
<p>Closer to the house, is a garden of wild flowers and herbs. My mother in-law
tends to this; deliberate in not cutting nor grooming once frost visits in the
autumn nights.</p>
<p>This is a paradise, designed by my mother in-law, with a mindfulness for the
birds; but also those sitting at her kitchen table, to be part of this place of
gathering.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p>Deep and cold frost felled fields.<br />
<br />
To go out, we must puff<br />
Our downy coats up. As morning<br />
breaks we gather amidst,<br />
the hanging hooks holding harvest gifts;<br />
Some on the floor,<br />
Others the benches held aloft.<br />
<br />
Each taking our communion<br />
of seed, berry, and bits of suet.<br />
<br />
Us, the now winter poor goldfinches,<br />
nut-hatches, cardinals, and chickadees,<br />
junkos, jays (of blue), house finches,<br />
and morning doves too…<br />
        or are we the mourning?<br />
<br />
Mourning of a peace lost to the starlings.<br />
<br />
Those big and messy colonists.<br />
Crowding us out;<br />
Tossing away more<br />
than just what they eat.<br />
<br />
Maybe that’s why brother bluebird<br />
Don’t come ‘round so much.<br />
<br />
Starlings you always make<br />
A seat at our table,<br />
Though never tend the floor.<br />
Is it beneath you?<br />
<br />
      Yet…<br />
  we yield<br />
        making room for all now here.<br />
<br />
A new congregation finding its peace;<br />
Though we notice not our dwindling bounty.<br />
Nor do we know to pray that<br />
our tending deaconess<br />
Replenishes our reliquary.<br />
<br />
Our lot is easier here—wait, no better<br />
than those afield;<br />
especially—were we to know—<br />
that field from whence<br />
came our stolen seed.<br /></p>
