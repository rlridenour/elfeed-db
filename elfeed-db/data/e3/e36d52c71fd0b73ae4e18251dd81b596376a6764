Over at the Emacs subreddit, Tb12s46 asks if <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tb12s46/">Emacs is privacy friendly</a>. By that he means does Emacs collect telemetry or otherwise spy on its users. On its face, the question has an easy answer. Of course Emacs doesn&rsquo;t do any of that. The project leader won&rsquo;t even use a cell phone because of privacy worries and Emacs development is open to all so any nonsense would be discovered immediately. In any event, Emacs is &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by its users not some corporation with an interest in collecting and selling users&rsquo; data.
</p>
<p>
But it&rsquo;s worth considering Tb12s46&rsquo;s query as a second order question. Is there something about the Emacs architecture that makes it susceptible to privacy abuses? Apple certainly thinks so. They won&rsquo;t allow it on iOS. Of course, that&rsquo;s because of its programmability, which Apple prohibits in all apps.
</p>
<p>
Still, one could argue that the programmability is a weak spot. Even Emacs recognizes this and strives to prevent executing any file that hasn&rsquo;t been explicitly authorized. On the other hand, Emacs is open source in a way that most other applications aren&rsquo;t: everything is delivered as source code so it&rsquo;s much harder to sneak in exploits. Sure, some people just load binaries of core Emacs but many of us compile from source so there can be no hidden &ldquo;features&rdquo; not visible in the (public) source. The bigger worry is third party packages but the news is even better in that sphere. There are no binaries there. <i>Everything</i> is delivered as source.
</p>
<p>
All-in-all, I feel pretty comfortable that Emacs is one of the safest applications that I use. The only realistic exploit is getting me to execute some random file but that&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;d do and even then, Emacs does its best to protect me.
</p>
<p>
So yes, Emacs <i>is</i> privacy friendly. It doesn&rsquo;t spy out of the box and it&rsquo;s not easy to add code that will do the spying.</p>
