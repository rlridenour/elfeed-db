Father,
</p>

 <p>
I’m surrounded by voices <br></br>
telling me what I want to hear, <br></br>
voices urging me to seek my own good, <br></br>
to protect what is mine, <br></br>
that my security is more important <br></br>
than the needs of others.
</p>

 <p>
Help me, Lord, <br></br>
to hear a different message, <br></br>
one that challenges me <br></br>
to become something <br></br>
better than I have been, <br></br>
and to dismantle my own petty kingdom <br></br>
for the sake of the Kingdom of God.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
