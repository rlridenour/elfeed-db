<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Reflecting on a novelist finding no joy in writing.
</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-01-29" title="2025-01-29">This morning</time>, the following quote rumbled onto my screen:</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="im-not-a-writer.-im-a-novelist.-And-the-novelist-does-not">
<p>
I’m not a writer. I’m a novelist. And the novelist does not know the joy of
writing.
</p>
<footer>&#8213; Georges Simenon</footer></blockquote>
<p>And immediately I felt a truth to it. I quickly wrote down the following:</p>
<blockquote class="h-cite">
When I’m a software engineer, I do not often know the joy of coding. Yet, when
I’m hacking on some code, then I know the joy of coding.
</blockquote>
<p>Though that too is not quite true. I like writing software (and blog posts and
poetry and documentation). But not all moments are equal. When I’m “hacking on
some code” I do so unfettered.</p>
<p>The “problem” I’m addressing with the automation is one I’m experiencing, to
which I’ve given importance and chosen to spend some attention. In this case,
coding is a conversation with myself. One in which I’m exploring my thoughts.</p>
<p>Contrast, when I’m the “professional software engineer”, I’m likely not
experiencing the problem which I’m tasked with resolving. I consider myself
above average, if only by a little bit, on delivering software solutions for
other folks.</p>
<p>I hear an unsaid lament of Georges Simenon, namely that they must write to
live. Whereas that he might not live to write. There’s no path of “Follow your
Joy”; which is probably <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-great-self-help-scam-an-industry-built-on-making-you-feel-broken/">some hook from the self-help industrial complex</a>.</p>
<p>I write my blog and share my non-work code, as <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/01/27/the-open-web-as-gift-economy-part-4/">Tracy identifies, with a mindset
of a gift</a>. There is code I write during my working hours that I wish I could
share, but that pathways not open at this point in time.</p>
<p>Even writing that highlights that I do find joy in work, but its in what I can
share, not what can I help capture.</p>
<p><time datetime="2025-01-29" title="2025-01-29">This morning</time>, I read Starbreaker’s <a href="https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/blogging-is-dead-just-like-god-and-rock-n-roll/index.html">Blogging is Dead: Just Like God and Rock &rsquo;n
Roll</a>; not quite saying that but the perception that blogging is dying is because
it is not as monetizable as it once was. And to be clear Starbreaker is all
about “art for art”, so is not siding with “stop blogging because its dead or
not making money.”</p>
<p>Hustle <em>Culture</em> is crap. Hustling to survive is not.</p>
<p>All of which sloshes around and near <cite data-id="675BCEF7-8799-4A11-8476-22F5EF9DCF77">In Praise of Idleness</cite> by Bertrand Russell.</p>
<blockquote class="quote epigraph" data-id="20221009T120500">
<p>
The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need
of slavery.
</p>
<footer>&#8213;Bertrand Russell, <cite>In Praise of Idleness</cite></footer></blockquote>
<p>And I recognize that so many systemic structures are repackaging enslavement, or
are in fact outright enslavement. We’re long overdue in collecting on the debt
of jubilee withheld.</p>
<p>In <time datetime="2025" title="2025">2025</time> I’m working towards joy, in part because it is a strategy (or ablation?)
against totalitarianism. Seeking joy can be somewhat challenging for me. I’ve
entrenched more pessimistic neural pathways than I’d like. But I am take steps
to weaken those and strength optimism.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading poetry each day.</li>
<li>Listening to bed time stories while nestled in bed.</li>
<li>Exchanging poems with my mother.</li>
<li>Reading of history.</li>

<p><time datetime="2025-01-28" title="2025-01-28">Yesterday</time>, during lunch I read <cite data-id="50692E9D-0DC3-4D57-92E6-395DAA08D615"><a href="https://commongood.cc/reader/a-few-rules-for-predicting-the-future-by-octavia-e-butler/">A Few Rules for Predicting the Future</a></cite> by Octavia Butler. Nestled within that essay, which everyone should read, is a
short poem:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p>All that you touch<br />
You Change<br />
<br />
All that you Change<br />
Changes you<br />
<br />
The only lasting truth<br />
Is Change<br />
<br />
God<br />
Is Change<br /></p>
</div>
<p>Joy is generative. It creates and expands the potentiality of all it touches.
It is not a distillation, threatened by model collapse, but instead the riot of
poppies bursting in a summer day; delicate yet defiant.</p>
<p>I don’t know how my joy might bring about change, but it is a chose of
non-shrinking; of not making it easier for the chains to tighten.</p>
<p>And I take solace that I’m not a novelist.</p>
