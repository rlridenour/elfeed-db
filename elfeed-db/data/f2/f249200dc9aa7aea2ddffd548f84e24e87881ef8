I recently started using John Wiegley’s [use-package]( <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package</a> ) for my Emacs init files. For Auctex, I used
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="org60d138d">
(use-package tex
    :ensure auctex)
</pre>

 <p>
and everything worked except for sync with Skim on OS X.  <code>C-c v</code> would not launch the Skim, even though I was confident that the Skim was set to be the default viewer. Instead, no viewer would launch, and I’d see “View command: dvi2tty -q -w 132” in the minibuffer.

After seeing that some others had used a slightly different configuration, I changed mine to
</p>


 <pre class="example" id="org2d1ac02">
(use-package tex-site
    :ensure auctex)
</pre>


 <p>
and everything started working fine. I still have no idea why, but it may help someone else.
