<li>Multiple ways to hold, apparently</li>
<li>Also: multiple settings, including soak, shower, mist, and jet</li>
<li>Pretty cheap</li>
<li>Can they make a margarita: No, but if you rig them up to a canister of margaritas, you could maybe spray hydrangeas with a little marg? It’s got what plants crave!</li>
</ul><h1>Not Too Difficult</h1><p>When we sold these in the Meh-rathon the other day, <a href="/@flintoid">@flintoid</a> asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were we having trouble holding our nozzles before?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a fair question.</p>
<p>And, to be clear, we don’t want to discredit the people who made these. Maybe they’re right. Maybe they studied the human grip, ran tests, consulted with engineers the world over, and designed something that is measurably “easier” to hold.</p>
<p>And maybe, after a season of using these, you would pick up a standard hose nozzle and wonder, how did you ever slum it with such basic equipment?</p>
<p>But… probably not.</p>
<p>Besides, the issue isn’t: is the marketing true? It’s: is the marketing compelling?</p>
<p>And the answer to that second question is definitely: no.</p>
<p>So, here’s our pitch, instead. They kinda look cool, don’t they? And you can get two of them from us for just $18. Which is a great deal, especially when you consider what else you get, which is some potential motivation to actually do a little gardening this year.</p>
<p>After all, some nice beds out front? A few beautiful window boxes? Containers full of homegrown veggies? It sounds awesome, right?</p>
<p>The only problem? This is what you get after investing a whole bunch of time and hard work. And what’s easier than committing to spending hours each weekend digging, weeding, watering, and all that? Committing to spend hours each weekend digging, weeding, watering, and all that… next year.</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe, if you buy some gardening gear, you’ll be more likely to actually do some gardening.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. Which is okay too, because, again, it’s just $18 for two of these. If they sit in the box for a year, you won’t feel too bad.</p>
<p>Also, you could use them to clean your car. Which, let’s be honest, is probably pretty gross and maybe about to be thoroughly coated in pollen.</p>
<p>Get some nozzles is what we’re saying. They <em>might</em> be easy to hold, and they’re <em>definitely</em> cheap.</p>
