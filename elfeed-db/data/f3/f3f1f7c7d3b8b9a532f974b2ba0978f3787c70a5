Eternal God, you whose image lies in the hearts of all people, <br></br>
Hear our prayer, as we pray for our nation.
</p>

 <p>
Help us to remember that you love all with your great love, <br></br>
that all faith is an attempt to respond to you, <br></br>
and that the desires of other hearts are known by you, <br></br>
just as our desires are known.
 <br></br>
Lead us to use what you have given us <br></br>
for freedom, justice, and equality; <br></br>
Not only for our own sake, <br></br>
but for those to whom these things have been denied.
</p>

 <p>
In our pride, teach us humility; <br></br>
In our strength, teach us grace; <br></br>
In our callousness, teach us compassion; <br></br>
In our riches, teach us generosity, <br></br>
In our ignorance, give us wisdom; <br></br>
In our fear, give us courage; <br></br>
In our anxiety, give us peace.
</p>

 <p>
May we be a source of love in the midst of hatred, <br></br>
And an instrument of peace in the midst of conflict. <br></br>
We pray these things in the name of the most high, <br></br>
The source of all that is good, holy, and true.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
