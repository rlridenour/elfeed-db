Lord Jesus,
</p>

 <p>
When the disciples heard your voice, <br></br>
they left everything they had <br></br>
to follow you.
</p>

 <p>
Examine our hearts, Lord, <br></br>
and show us those things that <br></br>
we also need to abandon, <br></br>
those remnants of an earthly kingdom <br></br>
That have no place in the Kingdom of God:
</p>

 <p>
The need to win,
</p>

 <p>
The need to get our way,
</p>

 <p>
Our feelings of superiority <br></br>
to our brothers and sisters,
</p>

 <p>
Our tendency to seek our own will, <br></br>
and to call it yours.
</p>

 <p>
We have muffled your voice <br></br>
in the frenzied noise <br></br>
Of modern life;
</p>

 <p>
Lest we hear, <br></br>
and, like the disciples, <br></br>
be compelled to follow.
</p>

 <p>
Yet in those occasional <br></br>
moments of stillness, <br></br>
we find that you still call.
</p>

 <p>
We pray to God <br></br>
that we can still hear.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
