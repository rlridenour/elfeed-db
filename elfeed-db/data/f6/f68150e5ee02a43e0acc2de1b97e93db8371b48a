<p><strong>Summary: </strong>
Thinking about the back and forth thoughts others (and I) have regarding digital and analogue. Especially in regards to writing.

In our history, our open history, we know the gifts of many poets: in our buried
history are lost songs and poems.

<p>This post is in response to Jack Baty’s <a href="https://baty.net/journal/2025/01/14/writing-on-a-tablet">Writing on a tablet</a>. And this first
quote is what sparked my writing.</p>
<blockquote class="h-cite" cite="https://baty.net/journal/2025/01/14/writing-on-a-tablet">
There&rsquo;s nothing that can replace the feel of writing with a nice fountain pen in
a paper notebook. Real paper is permanent and immutable. Put it in a box and
it&rsquo;ll last (effectively) forever. No battery to worry about. Flipping through
pages is a joy. I can paste small photos or tickets or quotes onto pages. Real
notebooks are infinitely cooler.

<p>I feel this so very much. <time datetime="2025-01-14" title="2025-01-14">Right now</time> my pens, inks, and paper are packed up and
inaccessible. Soon that won&rsquo;t be the case.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been writing more and more in <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" title="Other site-wide references of “Emacs”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-EMACS">&#128214;</a></small>
(obviously not quite a tablet). But
I&rsquo;m thinking about all these words I write and how my children (or their
children) might express interest when I&rsquo;m gone.</p>
<aside role="note" class="margin">
<p><small>One benefit of not having my notebooks, pens, and inks is that I’ve been able to
develop a daily writing habit. As someone with Attention Deficit, I struggle to
establish and maintain habits. But at I’m proud that, as of <time datetime="2025-01-14" title="2025-01-14">today</time>, I have
written in that journal for 69 consecutive days.</small></p>
<p><small>I’ve also “stacked” another habit onto that one. Namely, when I start my
journal it has checkboxes for my personal reading and writing goals: read one
poem, essay, fiction chapter, tend my feed, and write one response.</small></p>
<p><small>Importantly, I don’t beat myself up if I don’t accomplish each of those. The
goal is to piggyback on one habit, making it more likely that I can create a
virtuous cycle.</small></p>
<p><small>I’ve also thought about how I’ll proceed with this digital file. Namely I’ve
created a <span><a href="https://latex-project.org">LaTeX</a></span> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “LaTeX”" title="Other site-wide references of “LaTeX”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-LATEX">📖</a></small>
<a href="https://github.com/jeremyf/dotemacs/blob/5080f5fee1cb369228446540b01a63e36fc095a8/lib/jf-horizontal-printing.setup#L1">template that I’ll use for “archival” export</a>, from which I’ll
then print a copy. Unique to that template is rendering links. Each link I
render as “clickable” but also with a footnote that identifies the URL.</small></p>
</aside>
<p>And these digital files take a different kind of stewardship. The density of
information per cubic inch of material is mind-boggling. Yet that density of
information exists invisible to our analogue self, we need wizardry to make it
visible and hopefully known.</p>
<p>This density and invisibility, I suspect, makes it easy to lose and misplace and
disregard. The microscopic does not instill the sense grandeur like that of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Horse_Memorial">Crazy Horse</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Behistun">Mount Behistun</a>; or even the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias">poetic pedestal of Ozymandias</a>.</p>
<p>Whereas my paper <del>tomes</del> notebooks, the artifacts, can be (or not be) heirlooms
for my progeny. And there&rsquo;s no need for incantations and catalysts to read the
spells contained in these tomes. Though, perhaps the cursive will become more
inscrutable as we collectively drift away from its teaching.</p>
<blockquote class="h-cite" cite="https://baty.net/journal/2025/01/14/writing-on-a-tablet">
So here I am, confused about which approach makes more sense for me. My head
says to use the reMarkable for everything. My heart says to ink up my favorite
fountain pen and set to writing.

<p>Jack, my head and heart are right there with you. I know what my machines can
do. I know how to tell them how to change to suit my needs. My head, and the
years of conditioning as a professional software developer, screams “choose the
efficient thing.” But my heart screams “but what about the art and poetry of
it all?”</p>
<p>I’m less torn, as I spent time thinking about how I can move <del>data</del> writing
between mediums. And I’m betting on the analogue. Meaning that some of my <del>data</del>
writing will not be part of my machine’s indices; instead existing hidden and
opaque to those machinations. Though, were some intrepid soul to “digitize”
them, they’d be pleased because I have rather good handwriting and the <span>Optical Character Recognition</span> (<abbr title="Optical Character Recognition">OCR</abbr> <small><a class="ref" rel="tag opener" aria-label="Other site-wide references of “Optical Character Recognition”" title="Other site-wide references of “Optical Character Recognition”" href="https://takeonrules.com/site-map/glossary/#abbr-dfn-OCR">&#128214;</a></small>)
would
likely be very accurate.</p>
