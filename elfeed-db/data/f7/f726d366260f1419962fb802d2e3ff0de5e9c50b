<p>This is a post in my <a href="https://karthinks.com/tags/latex">Latex editing series</a>, a quick package announcement for better Latex previews.</p>
<p>After complaining <a href="https://karthinks.com/software/scaling-latex-previews-in-emacs/">the other day</a> about Latex previews in org-mode being unbearably slow, I decided to take a crack at adapting Org-mode to use AucTeX&rsquo;s <code>preview</code> library, which is blazing fast in comparison:</p>

<p>It was both easier and more annoying than I expected it to be, but perhaps less annoying on balance than <code>org-latex-preview</code> locking up Emacs for a good minute on every fresh invocation in medium sized documents.</p>
<p>For now the package is <a href="https://github.com/karthink/org-auctex">available online</a> in its fledgling state. It&rsquo;s intended for use as a drop-in replacement for <code>org-latex-preview</code>. Turn on <code>org-auctex-mode</code> and use your keybinding for <code>org-latex-preview</code> (or call <code>org-auctex-preview-dwim</code>), and it should use the Auctex-based backend instead. This is very early, everything including the name of the package might change in the future.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there&rsquo;s very little Org-specific code in there. It should be trivial to extend the <code>preview</code> library to work in Markdown and other text buffers.</p>
