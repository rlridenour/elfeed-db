Reflecting and joining in a lament about experiencing a slump in regards to hobbies and pastimes that bring us joy.

<p>
There was formerly a capacity for lightheartedness and play which has been, to
some extent, inhibited by the cult of efficiency.

about this ending passage:</p>

I don&rsquo;t know if this is just a brief slump or if it&rsquo;s a sign of a larger
shift. I hope it&rsquo;s the former. I&rsquo;d hate to lose interest in the one thing that
still holds my interest.

<p>My blog was once fully devoted to role-playing and board games. Over the years
this shifted, expanding to encompass poetry and personal posts. My house is
full, albeit less so, with games. These past few years my game playing has
dwindled.</p>
<p>In part because I favor the face to face. And coordinating schedules is
challenging. With my best efforts coming from scheduling weekly events. For
awhile I had two weekly events: Monday night games and Thursday night dinner,
drinks, and conversations.</p>
<p>However, with moving and changing jobs a few times, I’ve de-prioritized games.
Which I feel as a loss. But one that I find challenging to overcome looking at
all else that is unraveling. Yet play and laughter are medicine.</p>
<p>I want to get back to game play, I just need to plan my path towards
rehabilitation.</p>
