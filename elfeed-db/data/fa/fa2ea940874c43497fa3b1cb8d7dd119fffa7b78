God of compassion,
</p>

 <p>
In these weeks of violence and tragedy, <br></br>
we have mourned with those who grieve, <br></br>
cried with those who weep, <br></br>
sat in silence with those in pain, <br></br>
and protested with those who suffer injustice.
</p>

 <p>
But what should never happen even once <br></br>
seems to happen over and over again, <br></br>
until we are left with nothing <br></br>
but bloodshot eyes and numb hearts.
</p>

 <p>
Banish our fears, restore our hope, <br></br>
and give us a vision of what can be, <br></br>
if we were to give our neighbor <br></br>
the same grace that you have given us.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>
