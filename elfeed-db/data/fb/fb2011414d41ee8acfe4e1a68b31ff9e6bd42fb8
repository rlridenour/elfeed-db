<p>It occurs to me that the usual content of the blog has changed significantly in the previous few months. I don’t write about the newest Markdown based text editor that has been released. I write about some macOS stuff. But mainly I write about Emacs.</p>
<p>I don’t see that changing much in the near future. I have moved on from Obsidian, VSCode and the others into Emacs. I have BBEdit and iA Writer installed. I use them for specific things. BBEdit is my comfort blanket. It is there to remind me that if I get overwhelmed by Emacs, there is a tool which I can use to solve my current problem. iA Writer is there to provide me with its syntax checker and easy syncing with my iPhone.</p>
<p>I am not interested in the newest addition to the plethora of text editors which deal with Markdown. I use Emacs for that. Completely immersed in Emacs, I don’t have the energy to check some new editor out. Thus the content of the blog is going to change to focus on what I am working on and using. Sorry if you miss the previous focus.</p>
