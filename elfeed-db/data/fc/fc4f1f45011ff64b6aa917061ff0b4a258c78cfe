 <i>On the Tenth Anniversary of NorthHaven Church</i>
</p>

 <p>
For those who have given much <br></br>
And have gone on to their eternal rest, <br></br>
We give thanks.
</p>

 <p>
For those who labor joyfully <br></br>
So that others may see Jesus, <br></br>
We give thanks.
</p>

 <p>
For both laughter and tears, <br></br>
When shared with those who love deeply, <br></br>
We give thanks.
</p>

 <p>
And for a church where Christ is proclaimed <br></br>
Yet an Imam feels welcome, <br></br>
We give thanks.
</p>

 <p>
 <i>Amen</i>
</p>

“Now that you have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual love, love one another deeply from the heart.” (1 Peter 1:22)
